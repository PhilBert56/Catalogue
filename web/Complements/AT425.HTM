GRIMM N° 88, DAS SINGENDE, SPRINGENDE LÖWENECKERCHEN ET N° 127, DER
EISENOFEN<br>
I. MOTIFS INTRODUCTIFS<br>
I 1 - Récit relatant la cause de l'enchantement de l'époux animal :
souvent il a refusé la proposition de mariage d'une mauvaise fée qui
l'a changé en animal. Ce motif apparaît en général comme
"extra-introduction" à l'un des motifs suivants.<br>
I - premier groupe de motifs introductifs,I 2 à I 10 : l'époux enchanté
prend l'initiative des relations avec l'héroïne.<br>
I 2 - Un couple sans enfants adopte un animal ou un objet comme son
propre enfant. Celui-ci désire épouser la fille du roi et accomplit les
tâches apparemment impossibles que le père de la princesse impose comme
conditions au mariage.<br>
I 3 - Une femme donne naissance à un animal ou à un objet qui, devenu
grand, désire être marié. Souvent les deux premières fiancées sont
tuées par lui, l'une après l'autre, la nuit de leurs noces, parce
qu'elles sont soit méchantes, soit insuffisamment nobles.<br>
I 5 - L'époux enchanté demande une jeune fille en mariage, ou l'enlève
de force.<br>
I 6 - Il force le père à lui promettre la jeune fille<br>
I 7 - Il vit dans une fontaine ou un puits d'où<br>
I 7a - il attrape par sa barbe un homme qui vient y boire et force cet
homme à lui promettre sa fille<br>
I 8 - Il promet de guérir le père de la jeune fille en échange d'une
promesse de mariage<br>
motifs, I 11 à I 20 : la mise en relation est une conséquence des actes
du père ou des parents de l'héroïne.<br>
I 11 - Un homme se rend à la foire ou en ville et demande à ses filles
ce qu'il doit leur rapporter. Les aînées souhaitent des vêtements et
des bijoux, la plus jeune demande soit une rose ou une autre fleur,
soit encore un autre mince présent, mais dans un certain nombre de
versions elle souhaite un objet très étrange. La nature du cadeau est
indiquée dans l'analyse des versions.<br>
I 12 - Un père vend sa fille à l'époux enchanté en échange d'argent, de
nourriture ou de bonne fortune à la guerre, la pêche, la chasse.<br>
I 14 - Un homme perdu en mer, ou dans une forêt, ou se trouvant dans
une situation de ce genre, promet sa fille à l'époux enchanté en
échange de son aide.<br>
I 18 - Un homme trouve un pou dans ses cheveux, l'engraisse jusqu'à ce
qu'il soit devenu énorme, puis le tue, et conserve sa peau. Celui qui
devinera de quel animal provient cette peau obtiendra sa fille en
mariage.<br>
I 20 - Le motif de la marâtre cruelle apparaît seul ou en liaison avec
l'un des autres motifs.<br>
motifs introductifs I 21 à I 26, les actes de l'héroïne elle-même
entraînent sa mise en relation avec l'époux enchanté.<br>
Additions aux motifs I 6 à I 14 méritant d'être notées :<br>
I 28 - Le père promet de donner le premier être qu'il rencontrera à son
retour chez lui ; ce sera sa fille.<br>
I 29 - Quand l'époux enchanté vient chercher la jeune fille, ses
parents essayent de le tromper en lui remettant ue domestique ou une
autre fille que celle qui lui a été promise.<br>
[I 11 bis ? ou I 30 ? Les deux aînées refusent mais la 3e accepte pour
sauver son père]<br>

[III Autre -]<br>
IV. LA VIOLATION DES INTERDITS.<br>
La nature des interdictions attachées au mariage varie beaucoup et les
possibilités indiquées ici sont uniquement les plus fréquentes.
D'autres sont données dans l'analyse des versions.</p>
<p>IV 1 - Interdiction de regarder l'époux à la lumière. L'héroïne
obtient une lampe et le voit. Généralement elle l'éveille en laissant
tomber une goutte d'huile sur son corps.<br>
IV 2 - Interdiction de dire à quiconque que son époux-animal est, la
nuit, un beau jeune homme.<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Versions de Mme Massignon dans De bouche à oreille</p>
<p>9<br>
La bête</p>
<p><br>
Il était une fois un prince qui faisait un long voyage. Sur sa route,
il a rencontré une fée. Le prince plaisait beaucoup à la fée, et elle a
demandé à l'épouser; mais il n'a pas voulu y consentir. Alors, elle l'a
changé en bête, en lui disant :<br>
- Tu resteras bête jusqu'à ce qu’une femme t'accepte en mariage!<br>
Le prince possédait un château, et il a continué à y demeurer, sous
forme de bête, vivant toujours dans ses jardins. Dans la maison, il y
avait toujours une table garnie. Ceux qui pénétraient dans le château y
trouvaient un dîner tout prêt pour eux.<br>
Or, un jour, trois jeunes filles vinrent à se promener par là; et la
plus jeune, lasse de se disputer avec ses deux soeurs, s'échappa et se
trouva en face de ce beau logis. Elle y entra et y vit un repas tout
préparé. Ne voyant personne survenir, et comme la nuit tombait, elle
mangea le dîner, et resta à demeurer dans le château.<br>
Un jour, elle se promenait dans les jardins, quand elle entendit des
plaintes venant d'un buisson : elle s'en approche, et que voit-elle?
une bête qui lui parla en ces termes : - Reste à demeurer là, au
château, si tu le désires; tous les repas te seront servis, ton ménage
sera fait, et tu n'auras à te soucier de rien.<br>
La jeune fille a accepté. Tous les jours, elle allait se promener dans
le jardin, et elle y voyait la bête. Mais un<br>
beau jour, qu’est-ce qu’elle entend de nouveau? Les plaintes et les
gémissements d'une bête malade, prête à mourir. Elle y accourut et
s'écria :<br>
- Oh! ma pauvre petite bête, si tu ne meurs pas, je t'épouserais bien!<br>
A ces paroles, le prince se relève, et retire sa peau de bête; c'était
un beau jeune homme.<br>
La jeune fille était tout heureuse. Ils se sont fiancés; mais le prince
n'est pas resté longtemps avec elle,<br>
- A présent, il faut que j'aille retrouver mes vieux parents, lui
dit-il. Je serai bientôt de retour. Je te confie ma peau de bête.
Serre-la avec soin dans une armoire, et veille surtout à ce qu’il ne
tombe pas une goutte d'eau dessus.<br>
Le prince partit donc. Quant à la jeune fille, elle a reçu la visite de
ses deux soeurs qui - voyant son bonheur furent remplies de jalousie à
son égard. Comme elle leur avait conté son histoire, elles résolurent
de détruire la peau de la bête. L'aînée dit à sa cadette :<br>
- Prends une chaudière d'eau, et nous la jetterons sur la peau de sa
bête.<br>
Aussitôt qu’elles l'eurent fait, le prince rentra chez lui, dans un
grand désarroi.<br>
- qu’as-tu donc fait? Ma peau est perdue, et moi je ne puis désormais
rester ici; quant à toi, je ne peux même pas t'emmener avec moi. Mais
tu pourras vivre ici à ton aise comme auparavant. Tes deux soeurs vont
rester là comme coulombres (jambages) de porte, ainsi tu auras quand
même de la compagnie!<br>
Mais la jeune fille voulait absolument accompagner son fiancé, et
résolut de le suivre par tous les moyens.<br>
Comme le prince s'apprêtait à partir en voiture, il lui dit encore : <br>
Je vais te laisser trois choses en souvenir de moi : un rouet en or,
une quenouille en or, et un fuseau en or. Comme ça, quand tu fileras,
tu songeras encore à moi.<br>
La jeune fille se mit à pleurer. Comme il l'embrasse, elle laisse
tomber trois gouttes de sang de son doigt sur sa chemise, en disant : <br>
- Personne ne sera capable d'ôter ces trois gouttes de sang de ta
chemise, sauf moi.<br>
Là-dessus, ils se sont séparés. Le prince est parti en voiture chez ses
vieux parents, où il s'est mis à demeurer; et son père le pressait de
prendre femme, mais le jeune homme ne voulait pas en entendre parler. A
force d'insister, le père finit par venir à bout de ses réticences, et
le prince accepta la proposition de son père.<br>
Pendant ce temps, la jeune fille était partie à pied pour suivre son
fiancé, emportant comme gage de lui son rouet d'or, sa quenouille d'or
et son fuseau d'or. A force de marcher comme ça, elle est arrivée tout
en guenilles dans la ferme du père, où on l'a embauchée comme gardeuse
de dindons.<br>
Peu de jours après devaient avoir lieu les noces du prince. La jeune
fille l'a su elle l'avait bien reconnu, lui! même si l'inverse n'était
pas vrai - et elle a cherché le moyen de se faire reconnaître.<br>
En guidant ses dindons, elle a été trouver les lavandières qui
blanchissaient le linge de la maison en vue des noces.<br>
- Nom de Dieu! disait une des lavandières! on ne peut pas enlever ces
taches-là.<br>
Mais non, il n'y a pas moyen, dit une autre.<br>
La gardeuse de dindons s'arrêta devant elles.<br>
- Si vous me la donniez, cette chemise, moi j'arriverai peut-être à la
détacher.<br>
Une lavandière se mit à rire et à protester<br>
- Toi qui gardes les dindons, saurais-tu mieux laver du linge que nous?<br>
Mais une autre dit<br>
Bon Dieu! la voilà, cette chemise! toi, tu feras toujours aussi bien
que nous.<br>
Il faut aussi vous dire que le prince voulait mettre cette chemise-là -
et aucune autre le jour de son mariage.<br>
La gardeuse de dindons la prend, la frotte à deux reprises, et les
taches disparaissent.<br>
Quand les servantes rapportèrent son linge au prince, celui-ci fut
saisi d'étonnement en voyant sa chemise sans taches.<br>
- Qui a réussi à faire partir ces taches? demanda-t-il.<br>
- La gardeuse de dindons.<br>
- Oh! pensa-t-il, ce doit être elle, mais je n'ai pas pu la reconnaître
sous ses guenilles.<br>
Mais son mariage était décidé avec l'autre, n'est-ce pas! et les noces
eurent lieu.<br>
Cependant la gardeuse de dindons avait réussi à s'introduire auprès de
la jeune mariée, et lui fit voir son fuseau d'or, le soir des nous.<br>
- Oh le beau fuseau! je n'ai rien reçu de semblable en cadeau.<br>
- Si vous voulez, je vous le donnerai, à une condition C'est que vous
me laissiez monter dans la chambre de votre mari pour y rester avec lui
pendant toute cette nuit.<br>
La jeune fille avait tellement envie du fuseau d'or qu’elle y
consentit. Mais elle aussi avait des ruses! alors elle a donné à boire
au prince de l'eau d'endormie, de sorte qu’il s'est assoupi pour toute
la nuit, et la gardeuse de dindons n'a pas pu lui parler : elle a eu
beau l'embrasser, il ne s'est pas réveillé.<br>
Le lendemain soir, ç'a été la même chose : à la vue de la quenouille
d'or, la jeune femme a consenti à laisser la gardeuse de dindons monter
dans la chambre de son mari. Mais elle lui avait encore donné de l'eau
d'endormie, de sorte qu’il n'est pas sorti de son sommeil avant le
lendemain.<br>
Cependant, les servantes du château avaient entendu les plaintes et les
paroles que la gardeuse de dindons avait laissé échapper pendant les
deux nuits passées au chevet du prince. Elles allèrent trouver le
prince et lui dirent : <br>
- N'aviez-vous pas une autre femme, dans le pays où vous viviez
autrefois?<br>
- Non, mais j'y avais une fiancée, que j'aurais dû épouser.<br>
- Prince, voici deux nuits qu’on entend une femme gémir dans votre
chambre en vous appelant son mari, et vous ne vous êtes jamais réveillé
à ses cris. N'auriez-vous pas bu quelque chose dans un verre?<br>
- Si, à chaque soir.<br>
- Eh bien, ne le buvez pas ce soir; certainement, elle va venir et vous
pourrez lui répondre.<br>
Le troisième soir, la gardeuse de dindons a montré son rouet d'or à la
jeune femme; celle-ci a encore consenti, en échange du rouet d'or, à la
laisser monter dans la chambre du prince.<br>
Mais ce dernier, écoutant le conseil des servantes, avait versé le
verre à côté du lit.<br>
- Oh mon Dieu! c'est le dernier soir où je pourrai lui parier! et
peut-être va-t-il encore être endormi, se disait en tremblant la jeune
fille.<br>
Mais le prince ne dormait pas, cette fois. Ils se sont reconnus et
toute la nuit ils ont parlé ensemble.<br>
Le lendemain, le jeune homme dit à son père - Père, j'ai encore quelque
chose à vous demander. - Que veux-tu donc, mon fils? - Faites faire un
grand repas où seront rassemblés tous les domestiques du château; et je
veux avoir à côté de moi ma femme, et de l'autre, la gardeuse de
dindons.<br>
Le père consentit à cette idée singulière, et ce jour-là la gardeuse de
dindons mit sa belle robe pour paraître aux côtés du prince. Ce
dernier, au milieu du repas, s'adressa au maître de la maison<br>
- Père!<br>
- Que veux-tu donc?<br>
Si vous aviez perdu les clés de votre château, vous en feriez faire
d'autres?<br>
- Oui.<br>
- Mais si vous retrouviez les anciennes clés, plus commodes que les
nouvelles, lesquelles prendriez-vous?<br>
Mais, les anciennes, bien sûr!<br>
- Eh bien, c'est la même chose pour les femmes. J'avais une fiancée
dans un autre pays, et je l'ai retrouvée. C'est avec elle que je veux
vivre désormais.<br>
Et le prince prit avec lui la gardeuse de dindons.<br>
</p>

<p>La boule d'or</p>
<p><br>
Je vais vous dire le conte de la boule d'or.<br>
Une fois, il y avait une jeune fille qui vivait toute seule dans un
château. Un jeune homme venait la voir chaque jour, dans le but de se
marier plus tard avec elle. Tous les soirs, des vieilles femmes
venaient veiller chez la jeune fille, elles lui dirent :<br>
- Oh! mademoiselle! Quand vous serez mariée, nous irons vous voir au
lit.<br>
Le soir du mariage, ces vieilles femmes voulurent aller voir la jeune
femme au lit.<br>
Oui, mais cela déplut au jeune marié. Voilà que le mari s'en alla du
château, en passant par la croisée. Le voilà parti au loin!<br>
Et elle, la pauvre, cela l'ennuyait beaucoup, elle en avait beaucoup de
chagrin! A son tour, elle est partie, pour aller à la recherche de son
mari, mais elle ne savait où le trouver.<br>
Voilà qu’en chemin elle fait la rencontre de la Sainte Vierge, qui
était sa marraine, elle lui dit<br>
- Où vas-tu ma filleule?<br>
- Ah! marraine! je suis bien affligée. Mon mari est parti, la nuit de
noces; il est passé par la croisée, et je ne sais où il est parti.<br>
- Eh bien! tu vas voir : je vais te donner quelque chose pour te
permettre de retrouver ton mari. Je vais te donner une boule d'or, et
tu lanceras cette boule. Cette boule te mènera droit où se trouve ton
mari. Et puis, je vais te donner aussi une poule avec ses petits
poulets, en or; et enfin, je te donnerai un dévidoir en or. Cela te
rendra grand service.<br>
Voilà la jeune femme partie, et puis elle lançait cette boule qui la
mena droit devant un château où son mari s'était installé.<br>
Et son mari s'était remarié avec une dame...<br>
La jeune femme à la boule d'or songea à se servir des objets donnés par
la Sainte Vierge, elle sortit son dévidoir en or.<br>
La seconde épouse en fut émerveillée.<br>
Madame, si vous acceptez que je passe une nuit avec votre mari, je vous
donnerai un dévidoir d'or.<br>
Et la seconde épouse a fini par dire « oui ».<br>
Mais comme elle était rusée, elle donna de l'opium à boire à son mari;
ce breuvage l'endormit. Il ne put s'en aller le lendemain avec sa
première épouse... Le lendemain matin, dès qu’il fut réveillé, ils
parlèrent, lui et sa première épouse. Elle lui dit :<br>
Demain, tu ne boiras pas d'opium, et nous nous en irons tous deux
ensemble.<br>
Alors, que fit la jeune femme à la boule d'or? Elle se plaça encore
devant les fenêtres du château, et sortit cette fois sa poule d'or et
ses petits poulets en or.<br>
La seconde épouse fut encore émerveillée.<br>
- Oh madame, si vous voulez que je passe de nouveau une nuit avec votre
mari, je vous donnerai ma poule en or<br>
et tous les petits poulets.<br>
Alors, la dame a fini par dire encore « oui ».<br>
Cette fois-là, le mari ne but pas d'opium! Ils ne dormirent point tous
deux, mais s'en allèrent à la dérobée; ils<br>
emportèrent le dévidoir en or, la poule en or et les poulets en or.<br>
Ils n'eurent garde d'oublier la boule d'or; ils lui donnèrent un coup,
pour qu’elle les mène, et la boule les dirigea<br>
vers leur château.<br>
Et quant à la dame, le lendemain matin, elle ne trouva personne, ni
mari, ni poule d'or, ni poulets en or, ni dévidoir en or... cela lui
fit de la peine, mais il était trop tard.<br>
Et puis mon conte est fini.</p>
<p>Passa per un piti crô de ra<br>
Et véqué moun counté tchaba<br>
(J ai passé par un petit trou de rat<br>
Et voici mon conte achevé.)</p>
<p><br>
Aux confins des départements de la Charente et de la Haute-Vienne
s'étend, sur les deux rives de la Vienne, une petite région centrée
autour de deux villes : Confolens et La Rochefoucauld, où se parle
encore la vieille langue limousine, illustrée au Moyen Age par le
premier des troubadours, Bernard de Ventadour.<br>
Je dois ce récit à une octogénaire demeurant à Chassenon (Charente),
Mme Rougier qui l'avait appris tout enfant de son père, originaire du
village voisin de Saint-Quentin; il a été enregistré en parler limousin
au printemps 1961.</p>
<p>Il s'agit du conte-type A.T. 425, La recherche de l'époux disparu.
Mais ici, au lieu du motif initial de l'époux animal, il est question
d'une indiscrétion commise par de vieilles voisines envers le jeune
marié, surpris au lit. Le don par la Sainte Vierge à la jeune épouse
d'une boule d'or qui la mènera jusqu'à l'endroit où s'est réfugié son
mari, rappelle un trait du conte-type A.T. 451, La boule rouge (cf. mes
Contes de l'Ouest, n° 20, p. 175). Il semble que cette boule d'or se
soit confondue avec le premier des trois objets magiques donnés pour
servir d'échange, les deux autres étant une poule et des poussins en
or, et un dévidoir en or, alors que dans la tradition française la plus
fréquente, il s'agit d'un fuseau, d'un rouet et d'un dévidoir.<br>

<h1 align="center">East o' the Sun and West o' the Moon</h1>
<h1 align="center"><small><small>Popular Tales From the Norse by George
Webbe
Dasent [1904]</small></small></h1>
<p>Once on a time there was a poor husbandman who had so many children
that he hadn't much of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty
children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest daughter,
who was so lovely there was no end to her loveliness.</p>
<p>So one day, 'twas on a Thursday evening late at the fall of the
year, the weather was so wild and rough outside, and it was so cruelly
dark, and rain fell and wind blew, till the walls of the cottage shook
again. There they all sat round the fire busy with this thing and that.
But just then, all at once something gave three taps on the
window-pane. Then the father went out to see what was the matter; and,
when he got out of doors, what should he see but a great big White Bear.</p>
<p>"Good evening to you," said the White Bear.</p>
<p>"The same to you," said the man.</p>
<p>"Will you give me your youngest daughter? If you will, I'll make you
as rich as you are now poor," said the Bear.</p>
<p>Well, the man would not be at all sorry to be so rich; but still he
thought he must have a bit of a talk with his
daughter first; so he went in and told them how there was a great White
Bear waiting outside, who had given his word to make them so rich if he
could only have the youngest daughter.</p>
<p>The lassie said "No!" outright. Nothing could get her to say
anything else; so the man went out and settled it with the White Bear,
that he should come again the next Thursday evening and get an answer.
Meantime he talked his daughter over, and kept on telling her of all
the riches they would get, and how well off she would be herself; and
so at last she thought better of it, and washed and mended her rags,
made herself as smart as she could, and was ready to start. I can't say
her packing gave her much trouble.</p>
<p>Next Thursday evening came the White Bear to fetch her, and she got
upon his back with her bundle, and off they went. So, when they had
gone a bit of the way, the White Bear said--</p>
<p>"Are you afraid?"</p>
<p>"No! she wasn't."</p>
<p>"Well! mind and hold tight by my shaggy coat, and then there's
nothing to fear," said the Bear.</p>
<p>So she rode a long, long way, till they came to a great steep hill.
There, on the face of it, the White Bear gave a knock, and a door
opened, and they came into a castle, where there were many rooms all
lit up; rooms gleaming with silver and gold; and there too was a table
ready laid, and it was all as grand as grand could be. Then the White
Bear gave her a silver bell; and when she wanted anything, she was only
to ring it, and she would get it at once,</p>
<p>Well, after she had eaten and drunk, and evening wore on, she got
sleepy after her journey, and thought she would like to go to bed, so
she rang the bell; and she had scarce taken hold of it before she came
into a chamber, where there was a bed made; as fair and white as any
one would wish to sleep in, with silken pillows and curtains, and gold
fringe. All that was in the room was gold or silver; but when she had
gone to bed, and put out the light, a man came and laid himself
alongside her. That was the White Bear, who threw off his beast shape
at night; but she never saw him, for he always came after she had put
out the light, and before the day dawned he was up and off again. So
things went on happily for a while, but at last she began to get silent
and sorrowful; for there she went about all day alone, and she longed
to go home to see her father and mother, and brothers and sisters. So
one day, when the White Bear asked what it was that she lacked, she
said it was so dull and lonely there, and how she longed to go home to
see her father and mother, and brothers and sisters, and that was why
she was so sad and sorrowful, because she couldn't get to them.</p>
<p>"Well, well!" said the Bear, "perhaps there's a cure for all this;
but you must promise me one thing, not to talk alone with your mother,
but only when the rest are by to hear; for she'll take you by the hand
and try to lead you into a room alone to talk; but you must mind and
not do that, else you'll bring bad luck on both of us."</p>
<p>So one Sunday the White Bear came and said now they could set off to
see her father and mother. Well, off they started, she sitting on his
back; and they went far and long. At last they came to a grand house,
and there her brothers and sisters were running about out of doors at
play, and everything was so pretty, 'twas a joy to see.</p>
<p>"This is where your father and mother live now," said the White Bear
but don't forget what I told you, else you'll make us both unlucky."</p>
<p>"No! bless her, she'd not forget and when she had reached the house,
the White Bear turned right about and left her.</p>
<p>Then when she went in to see her father and mother, there was such
joy, there was no end to it. None of them thought they could thank her
enough for all she had done for them. Now, they had everything they
wished, as good as good could be, and they all wanted to know how she
got on where she lived.</p>
<p>Well, she said, it was very good to live where she did; she had all
she wished. What she said beside I don't know; but I don't think any of
them had the right end of the stick, or that they got much out of her.
But so in the afternoon, after they had done dinner, all happened as
the White Bear had said. Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in
her bed-room; but she minded what the White Bear had said, and wouldn't
go up stairs.</p>
<p>"Oh, what we have to talk about will keep," she said, and put her
mother off. But somehow or other, her mother got round her at last, and
she had to tell her the whole story. So she said, how every night, when
she had gone to bed, a man came and lay down beside her as soon as she
had put out the light, and how she never saw him, because he was always
up and away before the morning dawned; and how she went about woeful
and sorrowing, for she thought she should so like to see him, and how
all day long she walked about there alone, and how dull, and dreary,
and lonesome it was.</p>
<p>"My!" said her mother; "it may well be a Troll you slept with! But
now I'll teach you a lesson how to set eyes on him. I'll give you a bit
of candle, which you can carry home in your bosom; just light that
while he is asleep, but take care not to drop the tallow on him."</p>
<p>Yes! she took the candle, and hid it in her bosom, and as night drew
on, the White Bear came and fetched her away.</p>
<p>But when they had gone a bit of the way, the White Bear asked if all
hadn't happened as he had said.</p>
<p>"Well, she couldn't say it hadn't."</p>
<p>"Now, mind," said he, "if you have listened to your mother's advice,
you have brought bad luck on us both, and then, all that has passed
between us will be as nothing."</p>
<p>"No," she said, "she hadn't listened to her mother's advice."</p>
<p>So when she reached home, and had gone to bed, it was the old story
over again. There came a man and lay down beside her; but at dead of
night, when she heard he slept, she got up and struck a light, lit the
candle, and let the light shine on him, and so she saw that he was the
loveliest Prince one ever set eyes on, and she fell so deep in love
with him on the spot, that she thought she couldn't live if she didn't
give him a kiss there and then. And so she did, but as she kissed him,
she dropped three hot drops of tallow on his shirt, and he woke up.</p>
<p>"What have you done?" he cried; "now you have made us both unlucky,
for had you held out only this one year, I had been freed. For I have a
stepmother who has bewitched
me, so that I am a White Bear by day, and a Man by night. But now all
ties are snapt between us; now I must set off from you to her. She
lives in a castle which stands East o' the Sun and West o' the Moon,
and there, too, is a Princess, with a nose three ells long, and she's
the wife I must have now."</p>
<p>She wept and took it ill, but there was no help for it; go he must.</p>
<p>Then she asked if she mightn't go with him.</p>
<p>No, she mightn't.</p>
<p>"Tell me the way, then," she said, "and I'll search you out; <i>that</i>
surely I may get leave to do."</p>
<p>"Yes, she might do that," he said; "but there was no way to that
place. It lay East o' the Sun and West o' the Moon, and thither she'd
never find her way."</p>
<p>So next morning, when she woke up, both Prince and castle were gone,
and then she lay on a little green patch, in the midst of the gloomy
thick wood, and by her side lay the same bundle of rags she had brought
with her from her old home.</p>
<p>So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and wept till she
was tired, she set out on her way, and walked many, many days, till she
came to a lofty crag. Under it sat an old hag, and played with a gold
apple which she tossed about. Her the lassie asked if she knew the way
to the Prince, who lived with his stepmother in the castle that lay
East o' the Sun and West o' the Moon, and who was to marry the Princess
with a nose three ells long.</p>
<p>"How did you come to know about him?" asked the old hag; "but maybe
you are the lassie who ought to have had him?" Yes, she was.</p>
<p>"So, so; it's you, is it?" said the old hag. "Well, all I know about
him is, that he lives in the castle that lies East o' the Sun and West
o' the Moon, and thither you'll come, late or never; but still you may
have the loan of my horse, and on him you can ride to my next
neighbour. Maybe she'll be able to tell you; and when you get there,
just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and beg him to be off
home; and, stay, this gold apple you may take with you."</p>
<p>So she got upon the horse, and rode a long long time, till she came
to another crag, under which sat another old hag, with a gold
carding-comb. Her the lassie asked if she knew the way to the castle
that lay East o' the Sun and West o' the Moon, and she answered, like
the first old hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it was east
o' the sun and west o' the moon.</p>
<p>"And thither you'll come, late or never; but you shall have the loan
of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe she'll tell you all about it;
and when you get there, just switch the horse under the left ear, and
beg him to be off home."</p>
<p>And this old hag gave her the golden carding-comb; it might be she'd
find some use for it, she said. So the lassie got up on the horse, and
rode a far far way, and a weary time; and so at last she came to
another great crag, under which sat another old hag, spinning with a
golden spinning-wheel. Her, too, she asked if she knew the way to the
Prince, and where the castle was that lay East o' the Sun and West o'
the Moon. So it was the same thing over again.<font size="1"
 color="GREEN"></font></p>
<p>"Maybe it's you who ought to have had the Prince?" said the old hag.</p>
<p>Yes, it was.</p>
<p>But she, too, didn't know the way a bit better than the other two.
"East o' the sun and west o' the moon it was," she knew-- that was all.</p>
<p>"And thither you'll come, late or never; but I'll lend you my horse,
and then I think you'd best ride to the East Wind and ask him; maybe he
knows those parts, and can blow you thither. But when you get to him,
you need only give the horse a switch under the left ear, and he'll
trot home of himself."</p>
<p>And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel. "Maybe you'll
find a use for it," said the old hag.</p>
<p>Then on she rode many many days, a weary time, before she got to the
East Wind's house, but at last she did reach it, and then she asked the
East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east o'
the sun and west o' the moon. Yes, the East Wind had often heard tell
of it, the Prince and the castle, but he couldn't tell the way, for he
had never blown so far.</p>
<p>"But, if you will, I'll go with you to my brother the West Wind,
maybe he knows, for he's much stronger. So, if you will just get on my
back, I'll carry you thither."</p>
<p>Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they went briskly
along.</p>
<p>So when they got there, they went into the West Wind's house, and
the East Wind said the lassie he had brought was the one who ought to
have had the Prince who lived in the castle East o' the Sun and West o'
the Moon; and so she had set out to seek him, and how he had come with
her, and would be glad to know if the West Wind knew how to get to the
castle.</p>
<p>"Nay," said the West Wind, "so far I've never blown; but if you
will, I'll go with you to our brother the South Wind, for he's much
stronger than either of us, and he has flapped his wings far and wide.
Maybe he'll tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you to
him."</p>
<p>Yes! she got on his back, and so they travelled to the South Wind,
and weren't so very long on the way, I should think.</p>
<p>When they got there, the West Wind asked him if he could tell her
the way to the castle that lay East o' the Sun and West o' the Moon,
for it was she who ought to have had the Prince who lived there.</p>
<p>"You don't say so! That's she, is it?" said the South Wind.</p>
<p>"Well, I have blustered about in most places in my time, but so far
have I never blown; but if you will, I'll take you to my brother the
North Wind; he is the oldest and strongest of the whole lot of us, and
if he don't know where it is, you'll never find any one in the world to
tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you thither."</p>
<p>Yes! she got on his back, and away he went from his house at a fine
rate. And this time, too, she wasn't long on her way.</p>
<p>So when they got to the North Wind's house, he was so wild and
cross, cold puffs came from him a long way off.</p>
<p>"Blast you both, what do you want?" he roared out to them ever so
far off so that it struck them with an icy shiver.<font size="1"
 color="GREEN"></font></p>
<p>"Well," said the South Wind, "you needn't be so foul-mouthed, for
here I am, your brother, the South Wind, and here is the lassie who
ought to have had the Prince who dwells in the castle that lies East o'
the Sun and West o' the Moon, and now she wants to ask you if you ever
were there, and can tell her the way, for she would be so glad to find
him again.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know well enough where it is," said the North Wind; "once in
my life I blew an aspen-leaf thither but I was so tired I couldn't blow
a puff for ever so many days after. But if you really wish to go
thither, and aren't afraid to come along with me, I'll take you on my
back and see if I can blow you thither."</p>
<p>Yes! with all her heart; she must and would get thither if it were
possible in any way; and as for fear, however madly he went, she
wouldn't be at all afraid.</p>
<p>"Very well, then," said the North Wind, "but you must sleep here
to-night, for we must have the whole day before us, if we're to get
thither at all.</p>
<p>Early next morning the North Wind woke her, and puffed himself up,
and blew himself out, and made himself so stout and big, 'twas gruesome
to look at him; and so off they went high up through the air, as if
they would never stop till they got to the world's end.</p>
<p>Down here below there was such a storm; it threw down long tracts of
wood and many houses, and when it swept over the great sea, ships
foundered by hundreds.</p>
<p>So they tore on and on,-- no one can believe how far they went,--
and all the while they still went over the sea, and the North Wind got
more and more weary, and so out of breath he could scarce bring out a
puff, and his wings drooped and drooped, till at last he sunk so low
that the crests of the waves dashed over his heels.</p>
<p>"Are you afraid?" said the North Wind.</p>
<p>"No!" she wasn't.</p>
<p>But they weren't very far from land; and the North Wind had still so
much strength left in him that he managed to throw her up on the shore
under the windows of the castle which lay East o' the Sun and West o'
the Moon; but then he was so weak and worn out, he had to stay there
and rest many days before he could get home again.</p>
<p>Next morning the lassie sat down under the castle window, and began
to play with the gold apple; and the first person she saw was the
Long-nose who was to have the Prince.</p>
<p>"What do you want for your gold apple, you lassie?" said the
Long-nose, and threw up the window.</p>
<p>"It's not for sale, for gold or money," said the lassie.</p>
<p>"If it's not for sale for gold or money, what is it that you will
sell it for? You may name your own price," said the Princess.</p>
<p>"Well! if I may get to the Prince, who lives here, and be with him
to-night, you shall have it," said the lassie whom the North Wind had
brought.</p>
<p>Yes! she might; that could be done. So the Princess got the gold
apple; but when the lassie came up to the Prince's bed-room at night he
was fast asleep; she called him and shook him, and between whiles she
wept sore; but all she could do she couldn't wake him up. Next morning
as soon as day broke, came the Princess with the long nose, and drove
her out again.<font size="1" color="GREEN"></font></p>
<p>So in the day-time she sat down under the castle windows and began
to card with her golden carding-comb, and the same thing happened. The
Princess asked what she wanted for it; and she said it wasn't for sale
for gold or money, but if she might get leave to go up to the Prince
and be with him that night, the Princess should have it. But when she
went up she found him fast asleep again, and all she called, and all
she shook, and wept, and prayed, she couldn't get life into him; and as
soon as the first gray peep of day came, then came the Princess with
the long nose, and chased her out again.</p>
<p>So in the day-time the lassie sat down outside under the castle
window, and began to spin with her golden spinning-wheel, and that,
too, the Princess with the long nose wanted to have. So she threw up
the window and asked what she wanted for it. The lassie said, as she
had said twice before, it wasn't for sale for gold or money; but if she
might go up to the Prince who was there, and be with him alone that
night, she might have it.</p>
<p>Yes! she might do that and welcome. But now you must know there were
some Christian folk who had been carried off thither, and as they sat
in their room, which was next the Prince, they had heard how a woman
had been in there, and wept and prayed, and called to him two nights
running, and they told that to the Prince.</p>
<p>That evening, when the Princess came with her sleepy drink, the
Prince made as if he drank, but threw it over his shoulder, for he
could guess it was a sleepy drink. So, when the lassie came in, she
found the Prince wide awake; and then she told him the whole story how
she had come thither.</p>
<p>"Ah," said the Prince, "you've just come in the very nick of time,
for to-morrow is to be our wedding-day; but now I won't have the
Long-nose, and you are the only woman in the world who can set me free.
I'll say I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash the
shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it; she'll say yes, for
she doesn't know 'tis you who put them there; but that's a work only
for Christian folk, and not for such a pack of Trolls, and so I'll say
that I won't have any other for my bride than the woman who can wash
them out, and ask you to do it."</p>
<p>So there was great joy and love between them all that night. But
next day, when the wedding was to be, the Prince said--</p>
<p>"First of all, I'd like to see what my bride is fit for."</p>
<p>"Yes!" said the step-mother, with all her heart.</p>
<p>"Well," said the Prince, "I've got a fine shirt which I'd like for
my wedding shirt, but some how or other it has got three spots of
tallow on it, which I must have washed out; and I have sworn never to
take any other bride than the woman who's able to do that. If she
can't, she's not worth having."</p>
<p>Well, that was no great thing they said, so they agreed, and she
with the long nose began to wash away as hard as she could, but the
more she rubbed and scrubbed, the bigger the spots grew.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the old hag, her mother, "you can't wash; let me try."</p>
<p>But she hadn't long taken the shirt in hand, before
it got far worse than ever, and with all her rubbing, and wringing and
scrubbing the spots grew bigger and blacker, and the darker and uglier
was the shirt.</p>
<p>Then all the other Trolls began to wash, but the longer it lasted,
the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, till at last it was as black all
over as if it had been up the chimney.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the Prince, "you're none of you worth a straw: you can't
wash. Why there, outside, sits a beggar lassie I'll be bound she knows
how to wash better than the whole lot of you. Come in, Lassie!" he
shouted.</p>
<p>Well, in she came.</p>
<p>"Can you wash this shirt clean, lassie, you?" said he.</p>
<p>"I don't know," she said, "but I think I can."</p>
<p>And almost before she had taken it and dipped it in the water, it
was as white as driven snow, and whiter still.</p>
<p>"Yes; you are the lassie for me," said the Prince.</p>
<p>At that the old hag flew into such a rage, she burst on the spot,
and the Princess with the long nose after her, and the whole pack of
Trolls after her,-- at least I've never heard a word about them since.</p>
<p>As for the Prince and Princess, they set free all the poor Christian
folk who had been carried off and shut up there; and they took with
them all the silver and gold, and flitted away as far as they could
from the castle that lay East o' the Sun and West o' the Moon.<br>

<br>
In a certain country lived a man who had three daughters. So poor were
they that one day there was not even a crust of bread in the house; and
not knowing what else to do, the girls spun some thread. This they gave
to their father, saying: "Take this to the tscharschi, sell it for a
few paras, and bring home some thing to eat." The old man took the
thread, but no one in the tscharschi would look at him.
<p>While pacing to and fro in deep dejection, an Arab appeared before
him and asked: "What hast thou to sell, father?" The old d man showed
him the thread, and remarked that he must sell it in order to obtain
food. The Arab asked who had spun it. "My daughters at home," was the
reply. The Arab bought the thread and paid generously for it. He then
asked the man to give him one of his daughters. "I will speak to my
daughters on the subject," said the man, "and if I can persuade one of
them, thou shalt have her." So the Arab accompanied him home. Arriving
there, the father said to his eldest daughter: "If I offered thee an
Arab for husband, wouldst go to him?" She replied: "What could I do
with an Arab? Marry me to some one more useful." He then put the same
question to his middle daughter, whose answer was the same as that of
her elder sister. His youngest daughter, however, said she was prepared
to marry the Arab in order to lighten in some measure their burden of
poverty.</p>
<p>The Arab accordingly took the maiden under his care, and, giving the
old man much gold, he departed with her.<br>
<br>
AFTER they had gone some distance the Arab said to the maiden: "Shut
your eyes--open your eyes!" Immediately she found herself in a
magnificent palace with slaves supporting her arms as she ascended the
grand staircase. She imagined herself in Paradise, it was all so
wonderful. At the top of the stairs other slaves escorted her into a
chamber glistening with diamonds and pearls, for the walls and floor
were inlaid with these gems, while the ceiling was ornamented with gold
and silver stars. When she had taken a seat, these slaves remained at
hand with bowed heads and folded arms, while other slaves appeared with
a sable robe and a dress ornamented with gold and silver sequins in
which they clothed her.</p>
<p>In the evening delicious food was served to her in golden dishes,
the repast concluding with a glass of sherbet, after drinking which she
fell into a deep sleep. Immediately the slaves lifted her up and
carried her to bed. While she slept the bey of the palace entered, and
gazed at her in admiration, but departed before she awaked. When the
maiden rose next morning, slaves appeared to bathe and clothe her and
obey her slightest behest. Such was her daily life for three whole
months, until homesickness seized her and she longed for a sight of her
father and sisters.</p>
<p>One day she spoke of the matter to the Arab who had brought her
thither. "Lala," said she, "may I not be allowed to spend a few days
with my father and sisters?" The Arab replied: "Call me not lala my
name is Laklak Aga. I am the guard of the palace." Next day she
addressed him again as lala, and repeated her request; but the Arab
simply corrected her as before. On the third day, however, when she
addressed him as "Laklak, my Aga," he listened to her request: "I am
longing to spend one or two days with my father and sisters." "Very
well," promised the Aga, "tomorrow we will go."</p>
<p>The Arab spoke to his master the bey on the subject. The latter had
no objection, but impressed upon the Arab that he must not allow the
maiden to remain long out of his sight. Thus, on the following morning
the maiden prepared for her journey home with Laklak Aga, who supplied
himself well with gold. "Shut your eyes--open your eyes! commanded
Laklak Aga, and behold! they were at their destination, and in a few
moments the maiden was receiving the caresses of her now happy father
and sisters. There was great joy in the house that day.</p>
<p>With the money he had first received the old man had opened a shop,
and now the Arab gave him more gold with which to extend his business.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the other girls asked their sister how it fared with her,
"Not very well," she replied; "every night I have to drink a glass of
sherbet and I fall asleep directly." They next asked her whether she
had ever seen the bey. She answered that the Arab was the only man she
had ever seen. On this they gave her a sponge, saying: "When sherbet is
next brought to you, pretend to drink it, but instead let the sponge
absorb it; then lie down and seem to be asleep. You will thus see what
happens to you."</p>
<p>When the few days had expired she took leave of her father and
sisters and left her home under the Arab's escort. With " Shut your
eyes--open your eyes! " she found herself back again in the serai.</p>
<p>In the evening sherbet was brought as usual; but the maiden very
cleverly, while pretending to drink it, allowed it to fall into the
sponge she held. This done, she lay down and appeared to go to sleep.

carried her to bed, and, as usual, the bey came and stood looking at
her. Hearing footsteps, she could not help opening her eyes to see who
had entered, and the bey, seeing that she was awake, knew she must have
deceived them all about the sherbet. "So thou hast thought by cheating
us to satisfy your curiosity?" he exclaimed angrily. "As a punishment
thou shalt be shod with iron shoes, and with an iron staff in thy hand
thou shalt seek me for seven years till thou findest me." With these
words he disappeared.</p>
<p>The maiden was accordingly shod with iron shoes, and taking an iron
staff in her hand she set out on her pilgrimage. She wandered over
mountains, through valleys, and across plains, though on looking back
she found the distance she had travelled was but the length of a
barley-corn. Pursuing her way, ere long she met a Dew-woman who had a
horn on her head and tremendous feet. She greeted the Dew-woman with
"Salaam!" whereupon the creature answered: "If thou hadst not greeted
me I should have pulled thee to pieces and devoured thee." "And if thou
hadst not returned my greeting," retorted the maiden, "I should have
knocked thee down with my staff." The Dew-woman now asked whence she
came and whither she went, and the maiden told her all. Then the
Dew-woman informed her that Shah Jussuf the bey had just passed that
place, if she would go farther she would meet another Dew-woman who
would tell her more.</p>
<p>The maiden wended her way onward until she met the second Dew,
woman, who informed her that Shah Jussuf had passed not long ago.
Farther and farther she went, until she met a third Dew-woman, who was
cleaning a warm oven. The maiden asked her whether she had seen
anything of Shah Jussuf. "Why dost thou ask?" inquired the woman, who
was in fact the be s aunt. After the maiden had told her story the
Dew-woman observed: "If thou wilt, thou shalt remain with me. Shah
Jussuf visits me every seven years; thus thou canst meet him here."</p>
<p>Kissing the woman's hand, the maiden consented to stay. But the
woman proceeded: "Thou canst not remain with me in thy present form,
however, for I have forty sons, and if they saw thee they would eat
thee up." Saying this the Dew-woman gave the maiden a knock, changing
her into an apple, which the woman set on a shelf.</p>
<p>At night the Dew-sons came home and said to their mother: "We smell
human flesh!"</p>
<p>"What should a human being be doing here?" was the rejoinder.
Nevertheless, when they had finished their supper the mother asked: "If
anyone should stray hither, and, kissing my hand, beg me to receive him
as my child, what would ye do in my place?" "Accept him as our brother
and do him no harm," answered the Dew-sons. At these words the
Dew-woman took down the apple from the shelf, and giving it a slap,
transformed it again into a maiden. "Go and kiss your brothers' hands,"
she commanded. The maiden did so, and the Dew-sons accepted her as
their sister. Shortly after her arrival among them a little son was
born to the girl, and him also the Dews accepted as a relative, and
treated with kindness.</p>
<p><br>
EVEN years the maiden passed in their company, and when the seventh
year had nearly run out, the Dew-woman observed one day to the maiden:
"Shah Jussuf will be here soon. If he requests a glass of water, bring
it, and when he returns the empty glass, let it fall from thy hand and
break. I shall then pretend to be angry with thee, and by that we shall
see whether he loves thee. If so, he will not permit me to beat thee."</p>
<p>Some days later Jussuf appeared, looking very sad and careworn.
After greetings had been exchanged, his aunt asked him why he was so
downcast, instead of in his usual merry mood. "I am suffering the pangs
of grief," answered the youth; "wherefore am I sad." The woman
professed not to understand. Food was brought in, and while eating Shah
Jussuf asked for a glass of water. It was brought by the maiden, and in
drinking Jussuf kept his eyes continually upon her; he could not help
seeing in her a vivid resemblance to the wife he was seeking. Having
emptied the glass, he handed it back to the maiden, who, as though from
carelessness, let it fall to the floor, where it broke in pieces. Now
the Dew-woman sprang up from her seat, overwhelmed the girl with
reproaches, and would have beaten her soundly had not the Shah
interceded on her behalf, placing the blame on himself instead of the
maiden. The Dew-woman immediately calmed down, and dismissed the girl
with the words: "Get out of my sight."</p>
<p>Shah Jussuf could not help thinking of the maiden, and he questioned
his aunt as to whence she procured her, and whether she would not sell
her to him. The Dew-woman, however, would not agree to part with her,
saying that the girl was indispensable in the house.</p>
<p>Shah Jussuf remained a few days longer and then departed. Yet not.
withstanding, that it was his custom to visit his aunt but once in
every seven years, in three months he was back again. " Thou rascal i "
exclaimed the woman playfully on seeing him again so soon. But to the
maiden she said: "On thy account is he come; when thou bringest in the
food, upset the dish."</p>
<p>They sat down to supper, and the maiden on entering with the food
stumbled, and the dish overturned and fell. In a great rage the woman
mercilessly scolded her for her clumsiness in the presence of their
guest, and would have beaten the girl had not the Shah forcibly held
her back, entreating her once more to pardon the poor girl. Gradually
the Dew. woman became calm, but seemingly with great difficulty.</p>
<p>Again the Shah took his departure. When he was gone the woman said
to the maiden: "He cannot endure it much longer; he will surely come
again very soon, and when he does, open the door to him and tell him
who thou art. Moreover, wear the dress thou didst wear when with him,
and have the child by thy side."</p>
<p>Looking out of the window one morning she saw Shah Jussuf
approaching in the distance. She hastened to dress, and, with her son,
ran out to meet him. Seeing her in the dress she wore while at his
palace, the Shah knew the woman was surely his wife and the boy by her
side his son. Shyly and shamefacedly he glanced first at the maiden and
then at the child. Leaving the boy the wife fell on her husband's
breast, and with tears of joy at their reunion, told him all that had
befallen her during their long separation.</p>
<p>Shah Jussuf now sought his aunt and, kissing her hand, begged her
permission to take his wife and child away. "Take her and be happy--she
has suffered enough," said the Dew-woman.</p>
<p>Now with hearts overflowing with joy they set out for the palace of
Shah Jussuf. On their arrival home they were received with every
demonstration of gladness, for during seven long years the Shah in his
grief had not inhabited his palace but had wandered over the face of
the earth. Their return was celebrated with forty days and forty nights
of festivity and merrymaking. Shah Jussuf invited his wife's father and
sisters to take up their residence at his palace, and they all lived
together in happiness to the end of a long life.</p>

most extensively applied to the comparative study of folk narratives,
especially folktales, in an attempt to reconstruct and locate the
origin of the "Ur-form" of a specific taletype. Recent criticisms have
argued that this approach was based on a rather faulty methodology and,
therefore, its initial goal has since been abandoned as an almost
impossible task. Nevertheless, the sheer quantity of tale variants
which have been recorded and systematized, primarily because of the
initially enthusiastic interest in this method, has provided the
present-day folklorist with an almost inexhaustible wealth of data.
Because of the extensive records of the tales, one can easily visualize
how widespread a tale-type or motif might be and how certain variations
may be unique to one specific area or cultural group. </p>
<p class="paprastas">The occurrence of tales specific to a certain area
has induced C. W. von Sydow to formulate his theory of "oicotypes." Von
Sydow maintains that tales, just as plants, adapt to a certain
environment through natural selection and thus differ somewhat from
other members of the same species, in this case — general tale-types.
The process of oicotypification, he states, "consists of a certain
unification of the variants within one and the same linguistic or
cultural area on account of isolation from other areas" (von Sydow
1946:238). He further explains that "changes brought about by various
kinds of mutation, and by oicotypification, are naturally of the
greatest weight for a scientific study of folklore, and the results of
such a study cannot, even by the best methods, be correct unless they
are based on a right knowledge of the life of the folktale, and the
laws by which it is governed" (von Sydow 1948:239). </p>
<p class="paprastas">It will be the overall purpose of this study to
illustrate how the history, the folk beliefs and the general attitudes
and notions of peoples living in a particular cultural and geographical
milieu, may be the "laws" which account for oicotypic distinction of a
particular tale. </p>
<p class="paprastas">The topic of this study was generated by a
significant observation made by Swahn in his monograph, <b>The Tale of
Cupid and Psyche </b>(1955). The author suggested that the sub-type
"M" of tale-type 425 ("Search for the Lost Husband") is typical only of
the Baltic countries (Lithuania and Latvia), and is quite widespread in
both (Swahn 1955:340). It will be the specific purpose of this study to
analyze this tale in the light of Swahn's observation that the tale is
limited to the Baltic countries. An attempt will also be made to
demonstrate how certain aspects of Baltic culture are reflected in this
story thus imbuing it with a type o relevance which accounts for its
persistence in its particular geographic and cultural setting. </p>
<p class="puspavadinimas"><b>TALE-TYPE Aa 425, SUB-TYPE M</b> </p>
<p class="paprastas">Swahn outlines Aa 425 into seven main motif
subheadings. He establishes a subtype M of this tale-type on the basis
of the events which occur in the latter half of the story (section VI).
The specific motifs of the Baltic sub-type M, which are found in the
other sections (I, II, III) are listed below along with a full
denouement of the more diagnostic section VI: </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">I. <i>Introductory motif.</i> </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">An animal lies down on the clothes of a bathing
girl and refuses to yield them back to her until she has promised to
marry him. </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">II. <i>The supernatural husband.</i> </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">The heroine's husband is supernatural und
usually appears as a snake or the Devil. </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">III. <i>The marriage.</i> </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">The heroine gives birth to a number of children,
usually three. </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">IV. <i>The breaking of taboo </i>and V. <i>The
search for the husband </i>are absent in sub-type M. </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">VI. <i>The reunion.</i> </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">1. The heroine is allowed to visit her home
together with children only after having fulfilled a number of
difficult tasks set by the husband, such as wearing out iron shoes.<br>
2. Her husband teaches her a rhyme which will call him forth when she,
on her return journey, has to cross the sea. If he is dead the sea will
then foam red as blood.<br>
3. The heroine's brothers cajole or exhort her children into telling
them the rhyme, call forth their supernatural brother-in-law and kill
him.<br>
4. The heroine sees how the sea foams red, realizes that her husband is
dead, and, in her sorrow, changes herself and children into various
kinds of trees or birds. </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">VII. <i>Final motifs </i>are irrelevant to
sub-type M (Swahn 1955:24-34). </p>
<p class="paprastas">Swahn's outline of Aa 425 M may be further
elaborated by the following summary based on Lithuanian variants known
to the present writer. </p>
<p class="paprastas">A young girl goes bathing with her sisters in a
lake. A snake crawls into her shirt sleeve and promises to depart only
when she consents to marry him. She agrees (usually after being urged
by her sisters) and returns home. Soon afterwards a retinue of snakes
arrives at the family's homestead in order to fetch the bride for their
king. The parents attempt to rid themselves of these "matchmakers" by
deceiving them with various animals (usually "white as a bride," eg.
sheep, goose, pig, or cow). A cuckoo, however, reveals the deception to
the snakes and they finally impel the parents to yield up their
daughter. The snakes lead her away to the bottom of a lake (sea) where
a handsome prince (the king of the snakes) greets her in his grand
castle. The girl lives happily for several years and usually gives
birth to two (three) sons and a daughter. Eventually, the heroine longs
to visit her parents' home. Her husband, unwilling to let her go,
assigns to her several impossible tasks, eg. to spin a hexed bundle of
flax, to wear down iron shoes, to bake bread with no utensils but a
sieve. An old wise woman advises her how to accomplish these tasks and
her husband finally relents and grants her permission to visit her
earthly home along with her children. The husband tells them a magic
formula which his wife must call out when she returns to the shore of
the lake: </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">Žilvine, Žilvin&#279;li (vocative form of the
husband's name)&nbsp;<br>
If you are alive — foam of milk,&nbsp;<br>
If you are dead — foam of blood! </p>
<p class="paprastas">The wife and children are then enjoined not to
repeat this secret formula to anyone. </p>
<p class="paprastas">Amidst much rejoicing the heroine and her children
return home. Her family, however, does not want her to return to the
strange underwater home of her husband and they conspire to "save" her.
The heroine's brothers interrogate her children and after some threats,
the youngest daughter reveals her father's name and the formula. The
heroine's brothers then proceed to the lake and summon the snake king
whom they promptly slay with their scythes. When the unsuspecting
heroine arrives at the lake and calls her husband, a red wave rolls
towards her, and the grief-stricken mother turns herself and her
children into trees. </p>
<p class="puspavadinimas">MOTIFS CHARACTERISTIC OF SUBTYPE M </p>
<p class="paprastas">Both the Latvian and the Lithuanian texts reveal
quite similar accounts of this tale type. A graphic representation of
the main elements of each variant is presented in the Appendix. For the
Latvian texts, the schematic break-up relies on Swahn's description of
the particular elements. All the Lithuanian texts were traced to their
sources and therefore, their motif listings are more thorough and
detailed. </p>
<p class="paprastas">At the present, there are ca. 80 variants of this
tale in each of the Latvian and Lithuanian Folklore Archives.<a
 href="#Ref">1</a> For each variant in Lithuania there are numerous
records of almost identical texts which have been recorded from
hundreds of sources. Although there are some other tales for which
statistical evidence proves even greater popularity, this tale is
considered to be one of the most popular and widespread among the
Lithuanians. It is also important to note that this tale had been
adapted to various art forms — drama, ballet, poetry — which has helped
make the tale widely known.<a href="#Ref">2</a> </p>
<p class="paprastas">Thus, it is clear that the relatively few
published texts of the tales with which the report deals prevents the
writer from making any conclusions about the statistical significance
of certain variations. Nevertheless, some elements which tend to occur
in many of the texts can be presumed to be quite typical of the
unpublished ones and, therefore, the comparison of Lithuanian to
Latvian versions may be considered generally reliable. It is futile,
however, to engage in speculation about the importance of the less
uniformly represented motifs. For the purpose of this paper, it will
suffice to simply list some of the more characteristic motifs. In the
following discussion, the variants of the tale are designated by
numbers corresponding to their presentation in the Appendix. </p>
<p class="paprastas"><b>Introductory motif.</b> </p>
<p class="paprastas">The great majority of texts describes how the
heroine promises herself in marriage to an animal in order to persuade
it to return (crawl out of) her garment, ie. Lith. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10,
11, 12, 13/9 13);* Lat. 1, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13/6 16).<a href="#Ref">*</a>
Most of the variations occur in Latvian: in some she simply marries,
Lat. 2, 6, 9; she is drawn or lured into the lake, Lat. 4, 7, 8, 16;
the father is forced to promise his daughter in marriage, Lat. 14; the
daughter is promised to the one who guesses that shoes are made from
the skin of a louse, Lat. 3, Lith. 8; a lost ring is returned in
exchange for a marriage promise, Lith. 5; and the lost heroine is shown
the right path in return for a promise of marriage, Lith. 6. </p>
<p class="paprastas"><b>Supernatural husband,</b> </p>
<p class="paprastas">In all of the Lithuanian variants the husband is a
snake (Lith. žaltys) or a man called Žaltys, Lith. 4, 6. In the Latvian
tales, seven of the variants depict the husband as a snake, in six he
is the Devil (Lat. 15 describes the man as having blue teeth = the
Devil), in one he is the "Prince of the Sea" and in another he is
simply a boy. </p>
<p class="paprastas">A traditional feature which is independent of the
"Introductory motif" is that the husband lives under water. The
family's attempt to deceive the matchmakers is recorded in five of the
Lithuanian variants but in only one Latvian, i.e. Lat. 5. </p>
<p class="paprastas"><b>The visit home.</b> </p>
<p class="paprastas">In most of the tales, after living with her
husband for several years, the heroine bears him children, usually
three, and then asks her husband for permission to visit her parents.
This if found in twelve out of sixteen Latvians variants and in all of
the Lithuanian tales. </p>
<p class="paprastas"><b>The difficult tasks.</b> </p>
<p class="paprastas">This motif is present mainly in the Lithuanian
variants (ten out of thirteen), but in only two of the Latvian tales,
Lat. 3, 4. </p>
<p class="paprastas"><b>The formula.</b> </p>
<p class="paprastas">A versified formula with which the heroine summons
her husband is found in all the Lithuanian texts and nine out of
sixteen Latvian. The formula usually includes a direct address to the
husband, often a repetition of his name, and an invocation employing
the appropriate life-death symbolism. </p>
<p class="paprastas"><b>The snake-husband is killed.</b> </p>
<p class="paprastas">All the Lithuanian and most of the Latvian texts
traditionally explain that it is the heroine's brothers who exact the
formula from her children and it is the youngest child who reveals the
formula. Almost invariably, it is also the heroine's brothers who slay
the husband. There are only two Latvian variations of this episode:
Lat. 4 where the Devil-husband is killed by the heroine's father, and
Lat. 15 where a priest and a thunder storm entice the husband out of
the water and put an end to him. </p>
<p class="paprastas"><b>The transformation to trees.</b> </p>
<p class="paprastas">The transformation of the heroine and children
into trees occurs in seven of sixteen Latvian variants and in twelve of
thirteen Lithuanian. In three of the Latvian tales, Lat. 3, 7, 8, the
children are turned into birds, and in Lat. 15, they are turned into
stones. In two Lithuanian texts, Lith. 11, 12, the mother turns into a
cuckoo while the children turn into trees. In Lat. 4 and 30, where
husband is the Devil, the heroine manages to escape home. In Lith. 6
the heroine and her one daughter simply return to the home of the
heroine's parents. </p>
<p class="paprastas">In three of the Lithuanian tales, Lith. 5, 6, 13,
the name of the heroine is Egl&#279; 'Spruce', and in Lith. 5, and 7, the
names of the sons are said to be &#260;žuolas 'Oak', Uosis 'Ash', Beržas
'Birch', and the daughter is Drebul&#279; 'Quaking Aspen'. Consequently,
they all turn into these specific trees. In most of the other texts,
the name-tree correlation is not made but the sons are usually
transformed into an oak, ash, and birch, the daughter turns into
quaking aspen and the heroine becomes a spruce or dogwood. Since Swahn
does not indicate such specifics for the Latvian tales, they cannot be
compared to the Lithuanian tree data. </p>
<p class="puspavadinimas">NON BALTIC VARIANTS </p>
<p class="paprastas">There has been some discussion in the relevant
literature concerning several non-Baltic variants of this tale, but
these examples have been generally disregarded (cf. Appendix for
schematic outlines). The only Estonian variant was recorded in Ljutzin
where the population was approximately two-thirds Latvian at the time
of recording. The single example of this tale in Finnish tradition was
collected in Karelia and occurred in a Russian milieu with regard to
material and language so that is is difficult to determine the actual
source of the tale (Swahn 1955:340). Swahn's single example of a
Russian variant has also been translated by Ralston who himself noted
that no other such variants were known in Russia. "Stories about
serpent-spouses are by no means uncommon, but I can find no parallel to
the above as far as the termination is concerned" (Ralston 1873:118).
J. Balys has discussed two possible Russian variants (including
Ralston's "Water Snake") which he believed were descended from a
Lithuanian source.<a href="#Ref">3</a> The fact that the Lithuanian
variants were more complex led Balys to conclude that the Russian
versions were genetic descendants of the Baltic tales. Since A. R.
Andrejev did not even include the '<sup>:</sup>Water Snake" tale in his
<b>Ukazatel skazocnych suizetov </b>(Leningrad, 1929), Balys has
argued that the tale is quite definitely not characteristic among the
Russians.<a href="#Ref">4</a> Balys suggested that the borrowing may
have occurred when the Baits actually lived near the Tula region — the
location where Ralston's tale was recorded (Balys 1953:4). </p>
<p class="paprastas">There would then seem to be three possibilities
for explaining the non-Baltic variants. 1. The few variants, especially
those that are almost identical to the Baltic ones, may have penetrated
into the area surrounding the Baits in rather recent times. 2. The tale
may have been borrowed by one specific Slavic group at a distant time
in the past when it was in contact with the Baits. 3. The single
comparable Russian example (Ralston's) is the sole proof that the tale
was known at one time to both Baits and Slavs (and not borrowed), but
has since lost its popularity among the Slavs and has almost entirely
disappeared. </p>
<p class="paprastas">The first explanation probably directly relates to
the case of the tale in Estonia. The example of the tale in Karelia is
difficult to account for because of its ambiguous setting. All three
explanations are equally probable in dealing with the Russian variant;
however, it is a single example (acc. to Swahn, one of two acc. to
Balys) and, therefore, the possibility remains that it was a chance
occurrence. Whatever the case may be, it is still quite evident that
Swahn is correct when he argues that the tale is traditionally known
only to the Baltic countries. </p>
<p class="puspavadinimas">CHRONOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS </p>
<p class="paprastas">Those scholars who have concerned themselves with
this tale generally agree that it is quite old. J. Balys, attempting to
correlate it with three Indian tales (cf. Appendix), has dated the tale
to a time when the Baits lived further south of their present
geographic boundaries.<a href="#Ref">5 </a>Balys envisions that the
tale probably traveled from India through Persia, then on across the
Caucasus into southern and central Russia. The tale was conceivably
carried by merchant - travelers along the major waterways, especially
the Dnieper. The Lithuanians heard the story, liked it and accepted it,
while the Slavs, on the other hand, rejected the tale. In Balys'
opinion, the tale was adopted and further adapted by the Baits some
1500 years ago (Balys 1951:65). </p>
<p class="paprastas">Scholars in present-day Lithuania believe that the
tale probably existed in a more archaic form at some time when the
Latvians and Lithuanians formed a homogeneous cultural group and still
spoke the same language, ie. sometime before the sixth century A.D.
They base this assertion on the "primitiveness" of the tale and its
world view which is typical only to the two Baltic countries. Without
further elaboration by the Soviets, this "proof" hardly stands as a
viable diacritic for dating the tale. </p>
<p class="paprastas">Another explanation which Soviet scholars offer
with a more thorough discussion is rooted in Hegelian and Marxian
axioms concerning the socio-historical evolution of the family unit.
They argue that the basic conflict of the story reflects the
disintegration of the extended family into the nuclear family.
According to the Hegelian scheme, this process occurred among the Baits
in the fifth century A.D. (Sauka 1970:19-20). </p>
<p class="paprastas">It is apparent that both Balys' and the Soviets'
proposed dating of the tale leave much to be desired. Balys, obviously
concerned with Benfey's Indianist theory, devoted little discussion to
how and why the tale was adopted (if it indeed was) by the Baits. The
Soviet scholar, Sauka, on the other hand, seems totally preoccupied
with demonstrating that the tale is the reflection of the social
organization of the peoples and thereby dates the tale solely on that
criterion. The problem of dating the tale then still remains.
Hopefully, the following analysis will at least prove one thing — the
tale does quite definitely antedate the introduction of Christianity
among the Balts. </p>
<p class="puspavadinimas">TALE 425 M AND BALTIC CULTURE </p>
<p class="paprastas">Baltic culture is frequently described as
extremely conservative and dedicated to tradition. This is not mere
romantic and historical data. For the conservative aspects of the
Baltis languages one need look no further than A. Meillet who wrote
that: "Le lituanien est remarquable par quelque traits qui donnent une
impression d'antiquite indo-europeenne; on y trouve encore au XVIe
siecle et jusqu'aujourd'hui des formes qui recouvrent exactement des
formes vediques ou homeriques..." (Meillet 1964:73). Secondly, the
Baltic peoples (who at one time comprised several related tribes that
are now extinct, eg. the Old Prussians) were the last Europeans to
adopt Christianity. The new religion was introduced into Latvia and
Prussia at the beginning of the thirteenth century by the Knights of
the Teutonic Order. The Lithuanians resisted the longest and officially
only joined the Christian Church in 1387 through Poland. The new faith,
however, was introduced in a foreign language (Polish) and was not
understood by the Baltic villagers who remained pagan. </p>
<p class="paprastas">The merger of these two religions commenced in the
sixteenth century and continued for three hundred years, the Christian
missionaries never entirely destroying the old religion. The final
product was a syncretistic religion with only a veneer of Christianity
over a surviving core of pagan belief. In this way, the Baits clearly
distinguish themselves from their Slavic and Germanic neighbors who
accepted Christianity at a much earlier date (the Slavs <b>ca. </b>tenth
century, the Germans in the ninth century). As a result, these latter
peoples are farther removed from their pagan past and although various
folk-beliefs and customs may still exist as "remnants" of their ancient
religion, their initial meaning and intent has since become quite
obscured. Scholars may sometimes reconstruct plausible explanations for
pagan survivals in Germanic and Slavic folk-belief, but the "folk" as
such are usually quite unaware and unconcerned about them. In contrast,
Baltic peasants in the early twentieth century could often explicate
their own folk customs and beliefs in the same manner as their pagan
ancestors did several hundred years ago. </p>
<p class="paprastas">A particularly fine example of such long-term
persistence of belief from the pagan era to the present is the Baits'
attitude towards the snake, a major figure of tale-type 425 M with
which this study is concerned. </p>
<p class="paprastas">THE SNAKE </p>
<p class="paprastas">Chronicles, travelogues, ecclesiastical
correspondence and other historical records written by foreigners often
made mention of snake worship among the Old Prussians, Samogitians,
Lithuanians, and Latvians. The snakes were frequently referred to as <b>žal&#269;iai
</b>(cognate with <b>Žalias </b>'green') which has been identified as
the non-poisonous Tropodonotus natrix. Sometimes the chronicles also
referred to them as <b>gyvat&#279;s, </b>a word which is clearly
associated with Lith. <b>gyvata </b>'vitality' and <b>gyvas </b>'living'.
The following historical records should more than suffice to
demonstrate that snakes were worshipped widely among the Baits.<a
 href="#Ref">6</a> </p>
<p class="paprastas">In the eleventh century, Adam of Bremen wrote that
the Lithuanians worshipped dragons and flying serpents to whom they
even offered human sacrifices (Balys 1948:66). </p>
<p class="paprastas">Aeneas Silvius recorded in 1390 an account given
him by the missionary Jerome of Prague who worked among the Lithuanians
in the final decade of the fourteenth century. Jerome related that </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">The first Lithuanians whom I visited were snake
worshippers. Every male head of the family kept a snake in the corner
of the house to which they would offer food and when it was lying on
the hay, they would pray by it. </p>
<p class="paprastas">Jerome issued a decree that all such snakes should
be killed and burnt in the public market place. Among the snakes there
was one which was much larger that all the others and despite repeated
efforts, they were unable to put an end to its life (Balys 1948:66;
Korsakas, <b>et al </b>1963:33). </p>
<p class="paprastas">Dlugosz at the end of the fifteenth century wrote
that among the eastern Lithuanians there were special deities in the
forms of snakes and it was believed that these snakes were <b>penates
Dii </b>(God's messengers). He also recorded that the western
Lithuanians worshipped both the <b>gyvat&#279;s </b>and <b>žal&#269;iai </b>(Gimbutas
1958:35). </p>
<p class="paprastas">Erasmus Stella in his Antiquitates Borussicae
(1518) wrote about the first Old Prussian king, Vidvutas Alanas.
Erasmus related that the king was greatly concerned with religion and
invited priests from the S&#363;duviai (another Baltic tribe), who, greatly
influenced by their stupid beliefs, taught the Prussians how to worship
snakes: for they are loved by the gods and are their messengers. They
(the Prussians) fed them in their homes and made offerings to them as
household deities (Balys 1948: II 67). </p>
<p class="paprastas">Simon Grunau in 1521 wrote that in honor of the
god Patrimpas, a snake was kept in a large vessel covered with a sheaf
of hay and that girls would feed it milk (Welsford 1958:421).&nbsp; </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">works: Balys 1948:66-74; Elisonas 1931:81-90;
Gimbutas 1958: 32-35; Korsakas <i>et al </i>1963:22-24; and Welsford
1958:420-422. </p>
<p class="paprastas">Maletius observed ca. 1550 that... </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">The Lithuanians and Samogitians kept snakes
under their beds or in the corner of their houses where the table
usually stood. They worship the snakes as if they were divine beings.
At certain times they would invite the snakes to come to the table. The
snakes would crawl up on the linen-covered table, taste some food, and
then crawl back to their holes. When the snakes crawled away, the
people with great joy would first eat from the dish which the snakes
had first tasted, believing that the next year would be fortunate. On
the other hand, if the snakes did not come to the table when invited or
if they did not taste the food, this meant that great misfortune would
befall them in the coming year (Balys 1948:67). </p>
<p class="paprastas">In 1557 Zigismund Herberstein wrote about his
journey through northwestern Lithuania <b>(Moscovica </b>1557,
Vienna): </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">Even today one can find many pagan beliefs held
by these people, some of whom worship fire, others — trees, and others
the sun and the moon. Still others keep their gods at home and these
are serpents about three feet long... They have a special time when
they feed their gods. In the middle of the house they place some milk
and then kneel down on benches. Then the serpents crawl out and hiss at
the people engaged geese and the people pray to them with great
respect. If some mishap befalls them, they blame themselves for not
properly feeding their gods (Balys 1948: II 67). </p>
<p class="paprastas">Strykovsky in his 1582 chronicle on the Old
Prussians related: </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">They have erected to the god Patrimpas a statue
and they honor him by taking care of a live snake to whom they feed
milk so that it would remain content (Korsakas <i>et. al </i>1963:23).
</p>
<p class="paprastas">A Jesuit missionary's report of 1583 reported: </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">.. .when we felled their sacred oaks and killed
their holy snakes with which the parents and the children had lived
together since the cradle, then the pagans would cry that we are
defaming their deities, that their gods of the trees, caves, fields,
and orchards are destroyed (Balys 1948: 11,68). </p>
<p class="paprastas">In 1604 another Jesuit missionary remarked: </p>
<p class="paprastas">The people have reached such a stage of madness
that they believe that deity exists in reptiles. Therefore, they
carefully safeguard them, lest someone injure the serpents kept inside
their homes. Superstitiously they believe that harm would come to them
should anyone show disrespect to these serpents. It sometimes happens
that snakes are encountered sucking milk from cows. Some of us
occasionally have tried to pull one off, but invariably the farmer
would plead in vain to dissuade us... When pleading failed, the man
would seize the reptile with his hands and run away to hide it
(Gimbutas 1958:33). </p>
<p class="paprastas">In his <b>De Dies Samagitarum </b>of 1615, Johan
Lasicci wrote: </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">Also, just like some household deities, they
feed black-colored reptiles which they call <i>gioutos. </i>When
these snakes crawl out from the corners of the house and slither up to
the food, everyone observes them with fear and respect. If some mishap
befalls anyone who worship such reptiles, they explain that they did
not treat them properly (Lasickis 1969:25). </p>
<p class="paprastas">Andrius Cellarius in his <b>Descripto Regni
Polonicae</b> (1659) observed: </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">although the Samogitians were christianized in
1386, to this very day they are not free from their paganism, for even
now they keep tamed snakes in their houses and show great respect for
them, calling them <i>Givoites </i>(Balys 1948: II 70). </p>
<p class="paprastas">T. Arnkiel wrote that ca. 1675 while traveling in
Latvia he saw an enormous number of snakes. </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">die night allein auf dem Felde und im Walde,
sondern auch in den Häusern, ja gar in den Betten sich eingefunden, so
ich mannigmahl mit Schrecken angesehen. Diese Schlangen thun selten
Schaden, wie denn auch niemand unter den Bauern ihren Schaden zufügen
wird. Scheint, dass bey denselben die alte Abgötterey noch nicht
gäntzlich verloschen (Biezais 1955: 33). </p>
<p class="paprastas">The Baits' positive attitude towards the snake has
been recorded also in the late nineteenth century in the <b>Deliciae
Prussicae </b>(1871) of Matthaus Pratorius who observed: "Die
Begegnung einer Schlange ist den Zamatien und preussischen Littauern
noch jetziger Zeit ein gutes <b>Omen </b>(Elisonas 1931:8.3). </p>
<p class="paprastas">Aside from the widespread attestation of
snake-worship among the Baits and its persistence into Christian times,
these historical records also suggest an intriguing relationship
between Baltic mythology and our folk tale. Both Simon Grunau (1521)
and Strykovsky (1582) mention the worship of the snake in close
reference to the god Patrimpas. This deity is commonly identified as
the "God of Waters" and his name is cognate with Old Prussian <b>trumpa
</b>'river'. The close association between the snake and the "God of
Waters" has prompted E. Welsford to suggest a slight possibility that
the water deity Patrimpas was at one time worshipped in the form of a
snake (Welsford 1958:421). A serpent divinity associated with the water
finds numerous parallels among Indo-European peoples, eg. the Indie
Vrtra who withholds the waters and his benevolent counterpart, the
Ahibudhnya 'the serpent of the deep'; the Midgard serpent of Norse
mythology; Poseidon's serpents who are sent out of the sea to slay
Lacoon, etc. A detailed comparison of the IE water-snake figure would
far exceed the limits of this paper, nevertheless, it is curious to
note that except for the quite minor Ahibudhnya, most IE mythologies
present the water-serpent as malevolent creature — an attitude quite at
variance with that of the ancient Balts. </p>
<p class="paprastas">From the historical records it is difficult to
determine to what extent the ancient Baits might actually have
possessed an <b>organized </b>snake-cult. Erasmus Stella's account of
1518 concerning the Sudovian Priest's introduction of snake-worship
into Prussia might suggest such an established cult. In any event, that
the snake was worshipped widely on a domestic level cannot be denied.
In general it was deemed fortunate to come across a <b>žaltys, </b>and
encountering a snake prophesied either marriage or birth. The <b>žaltys
</b>was always said to bring happiness and prosperity, ensuring the
fertility of the soil and the increase of the family. Up until the
twentieth century, in many parts of Lithuania, farm women would leave
milk in shallow pans in their yards for the <b>žal&#269;iai. </b>This,
they explained, helped to ensure the well-being of the family. </p>
<p class="paprastas">In 1924 H. Bertuleit wrote that the Samogitian
peasants "even at the present time, staunchly maintain that the <b>žaltys/gyvat&#279;
</b>is a health and strength giving being" (Balys 1948: II 73). To this
day in Lithuania, the gabled roofs are occasionally topped with
serpent-shaped carvings in order to protect the household from evil
powers. </p>
<p class="paprastas">The best proof of the still persistent respect, if
no longer veneration, of the snake (or <b>žaltys </b>in specific) is
provided by various folk sayings and beliefs which were recorded during
this century. Some of them clearly reflect the association of the snake
with good luck, while others depict the evil consequences which will
befall one if he does not respect the snake. The following are some
examples:<a href="#Ref">7</a> </p>

48. If you kill seven snakes, you will win the Kingdom of Heaven </p>
<p class="paprastas">Such examples as these, however, are quite rare in
comparison to the folk-beliefs which are sympathetic to the snake. </p>
<p class="paprastas">Considering the evidence amassed from both
historical records and folk-belief that the Baits possessed a positive
and reverent attitude towards the snake, it is little wonder that the
snake husband's death is viewed as tragedy. If, as the proverbs
suggest, a snake's death can affect the sun, then what consequences
might the death of the very King of the Snakes have among mortals? This
tragic outcome, as Swahn has indicated, gives the tale a character
which is foreign to the true folk-tale (Swahn 1955:341). This tale
could not terminate on the usual euphoric note typical of the Märchen
(although the tale does contain numerous Märchen motifs) because the
main event of the story relates to a "reality" which the people who
tell the story still hold to be true. The tale is thus well-nourished
in a setting where such folk-beliefs about the snake persist. On the
other hand, the tale itself may have played a part in affecting the
longevity of the beliefs. Whichever case may be true, it is obvious
that both are closely related. </p>
<p class="paprastas">A specific element of folk-belief that survived as
an ideological support to the tale is that of the snake's name-taboo.
The tragic killing of the snake king is implemented only because the
name formula is revealed. Thus, the general snake-taboo proverbs (No.
21-30; receive a specific denouement in the snake-father ordering that
his name and summoning formula not be revealed to others. There appear
to be two important aspects that surround this name-taboo. First of
all, it reflects the primitive concept of one being able to manipulate
another when his name is known. A second aspect is that the name-taboo
may rest on the reverence and fear of a more powerful supernatural
being that requires mortals never to mention the deity's real name. For
example, Perk&#363;nas, the all-powerful Thunder God of the Baits, has many
substitutes for his real name which are usually onomatopoeic with the
sound of thunder, eg. Dudulis, Dundulis, Tarškulis, Trenktinis. In our
tale the general reason for the name-taboo may be partially related to
this second explanation especially since there are a number of variants
for the name of the snake-king, eg. Žilvine, which have no etymological
support but bear a suspicious resemblance to the word žaltys 'snake'.
This might then indicate a deliberate attempt to destroy the name <b>žaltys
</b>in such a way as to avoid breaking the name-taboo but still retain
some of the underlying semantic force. On the other hand, it must be
admitted that many of the summoning formulas include a direct reference
to the husband as žaltys. In these cases, since the brothers know his
name, they can extend their power over him. It is likely that both
these aspects should be considered when explaining the name-taboo of
the story. The clear distinction between the obviously Christian
folk-sayings (No. 45-48) and the underlying pro-snake proverbs carries
considerable significance when one views the substitution of the Devil
for the snake in many of the Latvian variants. This substitution
occurred in all probability with the increasing influence of
Christianity and its usual association of the serpent with the Devil as
in the Garden of Eden story. It is interesting to reflect that in some
cases the entire story proceeds with the same tragic development
despite this substitution (Lat. 2, 7, 9, 15). Even in the Lithuanian
variant (Lith. 4) where an old woman tells the heroine that her
snake-husband is actually the Devil, this does little to alter the
tragic tone of the tale's ending. Thus, it would seem that the Devil is
a relatively late introduction, sometimes amounting to little more than
a Christian gloss of the snake's real identity. On this basis, one
might well conelude that the tale must have been composed in pagan
times and is thereby, at the very least, four or five centuries old if
not far older. </p>
<p class="paprastas">The effect of the diabolization of the snake among
the Latvian variants seems to have led to a disintegration of the
tale's actual structure. In some of the Latvian redactions (Lat. 4, 8,
15) where the Devil is the abductor, the story simply ends with the
killing of the supernatural husband and the heroine's rescue. In
variants of the tale which progress with such a rescue-motif
development, it is important to observe that many of the other elements
are consequently dropped. There is no name-taboo or magic formula,
sometimes no children, and, of course, no magical transformation. Thus
the tale is stripped of all these other embellishments and appears
rather bare. It simply relates an abduction of the heroine and her
rescue, usually accomplished by some members of her family or a priest
and thunder storm (Latv. 15). In any event, the abductor is one whom
she quite definitely cannot marry and therefore, there can be no
Märchen marriage-feast. When the tale has been altered, the rescue
motif can then be correlated to the other Märchen tale-types where the
heroine is abducted (rather than married) and is eventually rescued by
an eligible marriage partner. One might even speculate that this will
be the eventual fate of those particular Latvian variants which no
longer specify that the snake, a sacred and positive being, is the
supernatural husband. We then have an intimate relationship between
folk-belief and folk-tale which ultimately may be mirrored in the very
structure of the story. </p>
<p class="paprastas">The place of the snake in Baltic folk-belief and
its relation to our tale now having been well established, the obvious
next question is whether similar beliefs exist in the neighboring
non-Baltic countries and, if not, might we propose this as a possible
explanation why the story as a Baltic oicotype has not spread to these
other cultures. A complete analysis of the role of the snake in
Germanic and Slavic folk-belief would far exceed the time allotted for
the composition of this study, nevertheless, some of the evidence
arrived at by way of a cursory review should be brought forth. </p>
<p class="paprastas">Of sole interest in our investigation of snake
beliefs among the Germans and Slavs is the extent to which these
cultures parallel the Baits with respect to the lat-ter's quite
sympathetic attitude toward the snake. Bolte and Polivka, Hoffmann -
Krayer and J. Grimm all mention that among the Germans there are some
beliefs which view the snake in a positive light. A few specific
entries in <b>Handwörterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens </b>are
similar to some folk-beliefs already cited among the Baits (Hoffmann -
Krayer 1935-36: VII 1139-1141). Bolte and Polivka in listing parallels
to Grimm's <b>M</b><b>ä</b><b>rchen von der Unke </b>cite several
instances of snakes bringing great fortune to those who treat them well
and disaster to those who disrespect or abuse them (Bolte and Polivka
1915: II 459-465) .<a href="#Ref">9</a> Both Hoffmann-Krayer and Grimm,
after listing various "remnants" of what they maintain might be
evidence for an ancient snake-cult in Germany, state that under the
influence of Christianity the snake is usually diabolized and its image
as a malignant and deceitful creature predominates. Only in some very
"old" stories are there traces of the original heathen positive
attitude towards the snake (Grimm 1966: II 684); Hoffmann - Krayer
1935-36: VII Sp. 1139). </p>
<p class="paprastas">Welsford, in writings about the snake-cult among
the ancient Slavs, states that it was probably quite similar to the one
which persisted among the Baits, but that the latter seems to have
retained it much longer. In the Slavic countries the snake was usually
regarded as a creature in which dead souls were embodied and through
time came to be viewed mostly as a dangerous animal. It is this aspect
of the snake which appears most often in Slavic stories. The snake
seems to be similar or even identical with other evil antagonists such
as Baba Yaga (Welsford 1958: 422). There are also many stories
involving a hero or heroine who has been transformed into a snake by
evil enchantment.<a href="#Ref">10</a> These stories primarily relate
how this "curse" is ultimately overcome. </p>
<p>These remarks indicate that the respect for the snake and its
association with good fortune was also known to both Germans and Slavs.
The heathen past, however, is farther removed from these peoples than
form the Latvians and Lithuanians. If similar snake-cults existed in
Germany and in Slavic lands, they were not practiced on the same scale
within recorded history as they were by the Baits. The cited fourteenth
to eighteenth century reports on the Baits were written by Slavs and
Germans and already then the surprise and disgust with which they
viewed Baltic snake-veneration gives us a good indication of the place
of the snake within their own cultures. </p>
<p class="paprastas">Cursory perusal of present-day Germanic and Slavic
beliefs about the snake seems to verify the fact that, indeed, the
snake is usually considered deceitful and malevolent. The majority of
folk-beliefs, expressions, and proverbs reflect this general negative
attitude. There are only a few examples of a positive regard for the
snake, usually associating it with powers of healing. One may speculate
that the folk medicine beliefs which prescribe the use of a snake as an
effective cure may be partially explained by the notion that evil
conquers evil (ie. an extension of <b>similia similibus curantor</b>)<b>.
</b>This, however, is mere speculation for it is also likely that the
snake's obvious vitality may be responsible for its specification in
various folk cures. This latter case seems to be well supported in the
Baltic beliefs (cf. folk-belief 38, 39) since the name for snake, <b>gyvat&#279;,
</b>and its association with <b>gyvata </b>'life' helps one to
consciously sense the logical correlation. </p>
<p class="paprastas">Stories which mention the affinity between snakes
and children are probably known throughout the world because they
describe an unexpected occurrence. W. Hand has suggested that the
credibility of such stories rests on the notion that the child's
innocence and helplessness can not be breached <b>even </b>by a snake
(Hand 1968). Note that this kind of logic presupposes that the snake is
evil. </p>
<p class="paprastas">Hence, although a more thorough investigation is
definitely required, one may still suggest that the Baits have
sustained through their history a more sympathetic regard for the snake
than either the Germans or Slavs. Assuming that this hypothesis may be
true, let us now see how it might be related to the discussion of our
tale. </p>
<p class="paprastas">When one assumes no comparable folkloric basis
among the Germans and Slavs with regard to the snake, then the Baltic
tale would make very little "cultural sense" to these people and even
if it penetrated into their cultural spheres, it would probably by
altered by the same process which seems to be occurring with the
Latvian tales. Secondly, even if we posit the existence of a similar
positive attitude toward the snake in these cultures at a pre-Christian
time, these beliefs would now seem to have almost entirely died out. In
any case, even though there may be some survivals, there has been no
comparative retention of respect and reverence for the snake among the
Germans and Slavs as one finds with the Baits. The narrative motif of
this tale clearly rests on a folk-belief which serves as an ideological
backbone to the story. Conversely, people unfamiliar with the
underlying folk-belief or possessing quite antithetical beliefs would
find this tale lacking in cultural meaning and, therefore,
"untransferable," at least in its original form. </p>
<p class="puspavadinimas">TREES </p>
<p class="paprastas">Another typical element of the Baltic 425 M tale
is the terminating motif where the heroine and her children are
transformed into trees. Swahn has commented that it is this motif which
gives the tale the character of an aition-legend (Swahn 1955: 341).
However, most Baltic aetiological-legends rarely possess such fantastic
Märchen-type motifs as a supernatural husband, difficult tasks or name
taboo and are certainly not so elaborate or complex as this specific
tale. The explanation for the curse-inflicted transformation is based
in Baltic folk-beliefs. First of all, the power of the heroine's word
is what brings about the arboreal transformation. To this very day the
Baits believe that a parent's curse is most effective in bringing about
dire consequences to her children. This belief is, of course, also well
known in other cultures. Secondly, one can observe that the
transformation into <b>trees </b>is typically Baltic. The full impact
of this motif to the Baits is directly related to their folk-beliefs
and is not simply an element of the story to be appreciated on an
aesthetic basis. The Baits have retained to this very day a special
empathy for trees. They believe that trees are like humans in that they
also have a heart and blood (sap). When cut down without good reason,
they feel pain and there are folk accounts of how real blood has flowed
out of injured trees. For this reason, parents always instruct their
children (as this writer was instructed) never to pluck leaves, break
the branches or peel the bark from a tree since it experiences the same
kind of pain as when someone pulls the hair of one's head or peels off
his skin from his body. Whoever injures a tree in such a manner will
eventually have to suffer a similar pain in his own life. Trees also
have a language of their own which man is unable to understand. One
can, however, hear a tree cry and moan every time an axe digs into its
trunk by putting his ear to the tree-trunk. </p>
<p class="paprastas">All these current beliefs stem from a conviction
rooted in the pagan era that the souls of the dead actually go into
trees, usually the ones growing near a person's homestead or more
specifically, near his grave. For this reason, trees in cemeteries are
considered especially sacred and must never be touched by a pruner's
hand since "to cut a cemetery tree is to do evil to the deceased"
(Gimbutas 1963: 191). This belief in total reincarnation of one's life
force in a tree has been slightly altered by the influence of
Christianity. It is quite commonly heard that souls which must undergo
penance for their sins are sent by God into trees. Thus, when a tree
creaks on a windless night, it is in truth the weeping and crying of
the penitent soul that one hears. One must then pray for them,
mentioning Adam and Eve, and the soul will be pardoned and the tree
will cease its creaking. It is said that souls in general inhabit old
spruces, but more specifically, a girl's soul will pass into a linden
or a birch while a man's soul will enter an oak, ash or alder. In
general, all trees are holy save the aspen which is believed cursed
because it was on that tree that Judas hung himself. This is directly
related to our tale where the youngest daughter, the one who betrayed
her father, is especially cursed and transformed into an aspen. </p>
<p class="paprastas">Another proof linking reincarnation with trees is
found in the funeral laments which have served as a reservoir of
on-going folk-belief up until this present century, In one, a mother
addresses her dead daughter: </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">What kind of flower will you bloom in? What kind
of leaf? What blossoms will you sprout when I walk by? How will I
recognize you? How will I know you? Will you be in flowers? In leaves?
(Šal&#269;i&#363;t&#279; 1967:42). </p>
<p class="paprastas">A daughter cries for her mother: </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">.. .I will ask my brother that he would plant a
birch on my mother's grave. When the cold storms will come, I shall go
up the high hill to my mother's grave. The birch branches will enfold
me like my mother's white arms. The north wind will not blow on me, the
biting rain will not fall on me (Jonynas <i>et al </i>1954: 522). </p>
<p class="paprastas">A daughter cries for her father: </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">Oh that a green plane-tree would grow from my
father's grave. All the beautiful birds would then alight there, and
would pick sweet berries. Oh, a mottled cuckoo would weep for you with
her song <i>(ibid.:52B).</i> </p>
<p class="paprastas">And a mother laments for her. daughter: </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">Oh my dearest little daughter, Oh, how will you
sleep in the black earth where the winds don't blow, where the sun
doesn't shine. Only the cuckoo will cry. Only the little birds will
sing in the white birch on your little grave! <i>(ibid.:533).</i> </p>
<p class="paprastas">Other than laments, many Lithuanian folksongs draw
analogies between man and trees or plants. The usual epithet for a
young girl is "white lily" and for a young lad it is "white clover."
Constant parallels are also drawn between a young maid and a green
linden and a young man and a green oak. As folksong scholars have
marked, this type of parallelism usually enhances the songs' poetical
quality and these traditional "formulaic expressions" may have
persisted precisely because of their aesthetic appeal. Nevertheless,
they seem to be instrumental in shaping the general world-view of the
people who sing them and it is, therefore, not at all surprising that
the Baits do feel this close identity with nature. The following
Lithuanian folksong well illustrates this: </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">Oh dearest father, don't cut the birch growing
near the road.&nbsp;<br>
Oh my own true mother, don't fetch the water from the stream.&nbsp;<br>
Oh my own true brother, don't cut the hay near the water.&nbsp;<br>
Oh my own true sister, don't pluck the flowers in your garden. </p>
<p class="atitrauktas">The birch near the road is really me, the young
one.&nbsp;<br>
The water from the stream — my sorrowful tears.&nbsp;<br>
The hay near the waters — my yellow hair.&nbsp;<br>
The flowers in the garden — my bright little eyes. </p>
<p class="desninis">(Balys 1948: II 64). </p>
<p class="puspavadinimas">CUCKOO </p>
<p class="paprastas">It is interesting to observe that in many Baltic
folktales, legends, songs and beliefs, women turn into cuckoos out of
grief when they have been separated from ones they love. This motif
constantly repeats itself in the laments where the mourner expresses a
desire to turn into a cuckoo and "weep with its song." This belief is
clearly reflected in those variants of the tale where the heroine
becomes a cuckoo and her children become either trees or other birds. </p>
<p class="paprastas">Any attempt to demonstrate that the tale is a
Baltic oicotype because of its close correlation to Baltic folk-beliefs
becomes more difficult when dealing with these other motifs of the
story. The power of a parent's curse, the transformation to some other
form of plant or animal out of grief, even the idea of reincarnation in
trees are not solely unique to the Baits but are found in other
European folk traditions. What may be somewhat atypical is that among
the Baits these beliefs are still widespread and constantly expressed
to this very day and find reinforcement in songs and laments. It may
then be argued that all of these factors help to imbue the story with a
cultural relevance for the Balt which might not be so quickly perceived
or deeply felt by a German or Slav. But it must be admitted that the
case for these motifs, ie. trees, cuckoo, is not nearly so strong as
that for the snake when discussing possible factors that would have
limited the tale to the Baltic countries. </p>
<p class="puspavadinimas">CONCLUSION </p>
<p class="paprastas">One conclusion that can certainly be drawn is that
the motifs of the tale and their ultimate structure (ie. sequence of
events) reflects many still very viable folk-beliefs which are
generally known to most Baits. This would almost suggest that the tale
is not as fantastical as it would first seem since it is so deeply
rooted in a folkloric reality accepted by the people who relate it.
Whether the story should therefore be considered a <b>Sage</b> rather
than a <b>Märchen </b>(its usual classification by folktale scholars)
is another matter. </p>
<p class="paprastas">The initial purpose of this study — to illustrate
how folk-beliefs may be the laws which account for oicoty-pification of
a folk tale — has been partially fulfilled. If one of the "laws" which
affect the life of a story is the relevance which it may have for the
people via various folk-beliefs and convictions, then that case has
been well demonstrated. But whether this relevance simply enhances the
popularity of the tale or is actually the crucial life-root which
maintains the existence of the tale and restricts its migration
requires much more substantial proof. If our analysis of the
disintegration of some of the Latvian variants is valid and the general
discussion of the folk motifs, especially the snake, is also of some

<p class="literatura">1 Information received by personal communication
from Norbertas V&#279;lius, Lithuanian Folklore Archive, Vilnius, Lithuania.<br>
2 Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain such specific information
regarding the tale in Latvian tradition.<br>
3 The second Russian story (Wratislaw 1889:160) to which Balys makes
reference may be questioned as to the actual correlation to the Aa 425
M. Swahn, who was obviously familiar with Balys' article (he cites him
in several instances), did not include the second story in his listing
of Russian variants. This leads one to suspect that Swahn might have
had some legitimate reason for disregarding this example.<br>
4 The story which Ralston translated first appeared in A. A. Erleiven's
book, <i>Narodnye skazi </i>(Moscow 1863, No. 2). Andrejev, in
compiling his study, constantly referred to Erleiven's collection.
Balys contends that since Andrejev, an authority on Russian tales, did
not mention the specific "Water Snake" story nor assign to in an index
number, this proves that he did not consider it to be sufficiently
typical of the Russian repertoire of tales.<br>
5 Only one Indian tale (Dracott 1906:15) to which Balys attempts to
establish a genetic relationship with the Baltic variants is included
in Swahn's monograph. In that particular case, Swahn classifies the
bale as sub-type A. The other two stories (Steel 1884:120; and Parry
1932:559) are not included by Swahn. Again, since Swahn cited reference
to Balys' article, it is unclear why he did not incorporate these other
two variants.<br>
6 The references to historical accounts have been selected from
Lithuanian translations of the records found in the following<br>
7 All the following folk sayings are translated from a collection of
current folk beliefs regarding various reptiles, compiled by J.
Elisonas in 1931.<br>
<i>Snake and sun<br>
</i>8 In contrast to Baltic belief, it is interesting to note that
among the Germans there is great antipathy between the two. Thus,
Panzer cites "dass man eine Schlange mit Berührung eines Eschenzweiges
töten kann" or "dass eine Schlange eher in ein Peuer springen würde,
als in den Schatten eines Eschbaumes" (Panzer 1954: I 213).<br>
9 That the serpent as a bringer of treasure may be associated with the
common German motif of a treasure-hoarding snake-dragon is quite
possible. I am unaware of any Baltic evidence of a similar
treasure-hording serpent.<br>
10 Evil enchantment is not the only cause for such transformation in
Germanic lore. Panzer cites a story where a young girl is changed into
a snake by God as punishment for a sin (Panzer 1954: I 117). </p>
