<p align="center">The Wizard and his Pupil</p>
<p>THERE was once a woman who had a son. To whatever school she sent
him, he always ran away. Perplexed, the mother asked the boy "Where
shall I send you?" To which he answered: "Do not send me, but go with
me; if I like the place I will not run away." So she took him with her
to market, and there they watched a number of men working at various
handicrafts, and among them was a wizard. </p>
<p>The boy was very much attracted by this last, and requested his
mother to apprentice him to the wizard. She went to the man and told
him her son's desire. The matter was soon arranged to their mutual
satisfaction, and the boy was left with his master, as the wizard was
henceforth to be.</p>
<p>In the course of time the youth had learnt all that the wizard was
able to teach him, and one day his master said: "I will transform
myself into a ram; take me to market and sell me, but be sure to keep
the rope." The youth agreed, and the wizard accordingly changed himself
into a ram. The youth took the animal to the auctioneer, who sold it in
the marketplace. It was bought by a man for five hundred piastres, but
the youth kept the rope as he was instructed. In the evening the
master, having resumed his human form, escaped from the buyer of the
ram and came home.</p>
<p>Next day the wizard said to his pupil: "I am now going to transform
myself into a horse; take me and sell me, but guard the rope." <font
 color="green" size="-1">"</font>I understand," answered the youth, and
led the horse to market, where it was sold by auction for a thousand
piastres. The pupil kept the rope, however, and came home. An idea
struck him: "Now let me see," said he to himself, "whether I cannot
help myself," and he went to his mother. "Mother," said he when they
met, "I have learnt all that was to be learnt. Many thanks for
apprenticing me to that wizard; I shall now be able to make a great
deal of money." The poor woman did not understand what he meant, and
said: "My son, what will you do? I hope you are not going to run away
again and give me further trouble." "No," he answered. "Tomorrow I
shall change myself into a bathing establishment, which you will sell;
but take care not to sell the key of the door with it, or I am lost."</p>
<p>While the youth was thus discoursing with his mother, the wizard
escaped from the man who had bought him as a horse, and came home.
Finding his apprentice not there, he became angry. "You
good-for-nothing; you have sold me completely this time, it seems; but
wait until you fall into my hands again!" That night he remained at
home, and next morning went out in search of his truant pupil.</p>
<p>The youth transformed himself into a beautiful bathing
establishment, which his mother put up for sale by auction. All the
people of the town were astonished at its magnificence, and multitudes
collected round the auctioneer. The wizard was among the crowd, and
guessed at once that this stately building was in reality his rascally
pupil. He said nothing of that, however, but when all the pashas, beys,
and other people had bid their highest he bid higher still, and the
building was knocked down to him. The woman was called, and when the
wizard was about to hand her the money she explained that she could not
give up the key. Then the wizard said he would not pay unless he
received it. He showed her that he had plenty of money, and observed to
the woman that that particular key was of no importance to her; she
could easily buy another if she must have one. Many of the bystanders
expressed their agreement with the purchaser, and as the woman knew not
the true significance of keeping the key, she parted with it to the
wizard in return for the price of the bathing establishment. When she
gave up the key the youth felt that his time had come, so he changed
himself into a bird and flew away. His master, however, changed himself
into a falcon and pursued him. They both flew a long distance until
they reached another town, where the Padishah was entertaining himself
with his court in the palace garden.</p>
<p>As a last resource, the youth now changed himself into a beautiful
rose and fell at the feet of the Padishah. The King expressed his
surprise at seeing the rose, as that flower was not then in season. "
It is a gift from Allah," he concluded. "It smells so sweetly that not
even in the rose-flowering season could its equal be found."</p>
<p>The wizard now resumed his human form and entered the garden, lute
in hand, as a minnesinger. As he was striking his instrument he was
observed by the Padishah, who, calling him, ordered him to play and
sing his songs. In one of his impromptu ballads the singer requested
the Padishah to give him the rose. Hearing this the King was angry, and
said: "What say you, fellow? This rose was given me by Allah! How dare
you, a mere wanderer, demand it?" "O Shah," answered the singer, " my
occupation is obvious; I have fallen in love with the rose you possess.
I have been seeking it for many years, but till now have I been unable
to find it. If you give it not to me I shall kill myself. Would not
that be a pity? I have followed it over hill and fell, to find it now
in the hands of the mild and gracious Padishah. Have you no pity for a
poor man like me, who has lost love and light and happiness? Is it
seemly to afflict me thus? I will not move from this spot until you
give me the rose."</p>
<p>The Padishah was moved, and said to himself: "After all, of what
consequence is the rose to me? Let the unfortunate man attain his
object." Saying these words he stepped forward and handed the flower to
the singer. But before the latter could grasp it, it fell to the ground
and was changed into millet pulp. Quickly the wizard transformed
himself into a cock and ate it up. One grain, however, fell under the
Padishah's foot and so escaped the cock's attention. This grain
suddenly changed into the youth, who picked up the cock and wrung its
neck--in other words, he disposed of his master.
</p>
<p>The Padishah was astonished at these strange proceedings, and
commanded the young man to explain the riddle. He told the King every
thing from beginning to end, and the monarch was so delighted with his
skill in magic that he appointed him Grand Vezir and gave him his
daughter in marriage. The young man was now able to provide for his
mother, and thus everybody lived happily ever after.</p>

I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Master and Pupil<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>(or
the Devil Outwitted)
<p>ONCE upon a time there was a poor peasant who had one son. And it
came to pass that his wife said to him: 'He should learn some trade,
for when he is separated from thee, what will he do if he is left
ignorant like thee?' The wife importuned him; she gave him no rest. So
the peasant took his child, and went to seek a master for him. On the
way they were thirsty. He saw a rivulet, drank eagerly till his thirst
was quenched, and when he lifted up his head he cried out: 'Ah! how
good thou art!' <a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">1</font></a> On saying
this, there came forth from the water a devil in the form of a man, and
said to the peasant: 'What dost thou want, O man! I am Vakhraca; what
troubles thee?' The peasant told him all his story. The devil, when he
learnt this, said: 'Give me this son of thine: I will teach him for one
year, then come hither; if thou knowest him, it is well, he will go
with thee; if not, he is mine and mine alone, he shall be lost to thee.'</p>
<p>Now this devil had other children to bring up on the same
conditions; and, since in a year children change so much that their
parents may no longer know them, the devil always had the best of it.
The peasant knew nothing about this; he agreed to the proposal, and
went home. A year passed by, and the father of the child came to the
devil; he did not find the devil at home. He saw in the courtyard a
multitude of boys, and looked again and again, but could not recognise
his boy. He was sad. However, his own son came up and knew him. Then
the boy said: 'Presently my instructor will come; he will turn us all
into doves, and we shall fly away; in the flight I shall fly before
all, and in the return I shall be behind all; and when my master asks
thee which is thy son, thou wilt point to me.' The peasant rejoiced,
and awaited the master with a hopeful heart. In a little while the
master appeared. He called his pupils, turned them into doves, and
ordered them to fly away. The peasant's son flew before all, and when
they returned remained behind. The master inquired: 'Now, dost thou
know which is thy son?' The peasant pointed him out. The devil was
enraged when he perceived the trick his pupil had played him, but what
did it matter! The boy left him.</p>
<p>The father went and took his son with him. They came to a place
where nobles were hunting: some greyhounds were pursuing a hare, but
they could not catch it. The boy said to his father: 'Go thou into the
wood, raise a hare. I will turn into a hound, and will seize it before
the eyes of these nobles. The nobles will follow thee, and will be
anxious to buy me. Ask a high price, and sell me to them. Then I shall
seize the first opportunity to escape, and overtake thee on the road.'
The father went into the wood and started a hare; his son turned into a
hound, pursued the hare, and, just before the eyes of the nobles, he
pounced on it. They crowded round the peasant, and insisted upon buying
the dog. The peasant asked a high price, which they paid in exchange
for the hound. The nobles attached a cord to the dog, and went away.
When they had travelled a little way along the road a hare started from
the thicket. They let the hound loose, and sent him after it. When he
had chased the hare a long way, and had lost sight of the nobles, he
changed again into a boy, and followed his father.</p>
<p>The father and son went on their way; the money seemed inadequate.
'I must get some more,' said the son. They looked round; another party
of nobles were pursuing a pheasant; the falcons flew after it, but for
some reason could not catch it. The boy changed himself into a falcon,
and sported with the pheasant in the air, just before the nobles' eyes.
He brought it down; they were frantic with pleasure, and said to the
peasant: 'Thou must sell this falcon to us.' The peasant again fixed a
high price, to which the nobles agreed, and this they paid him in
exchange for the falcon. The peasant went on his way. The nobles, after
travelling some distance, sent the falcon in pursuit of another
pheasant. The falcon flew after the bird, and, when he was out of the
nobles' sight, changed into a boy and joined his father.</p>
<p>The father and son went on with their money, but the son was not
content with it. He said to his father: 'Come, I will change into a
splendid horse; mount me, go into a town and sell me. But remember not
to sell me to a man with variegated eyes; if thou dost, do not give him
the bridle, for then, thou knowest, I shall not be able to free myself
from his hands.' On saying this, the boy changed into a splendid,
spirited horse, his father mounted and rode into the town. Here he saw
many who wanted to buy it, but more eager than any was a man with
variegated eyes. Whenever any one added a <i>manethi</i> (rouble) to
the price, he added a <i>thuman</i> (ten roubles). Love of money
conquered the peasant, and he sold the horse to the man with variegated
eyes. He bought the bridle with it, mounted the horse and spurred it
on. He went, disappeared, and could no longer contain his joy that he
had his pupil once more in his power. He reached home, shut the horse
in a dark room, and locked the door. His pupil lay down and was sad; he
thought and grieved, but there seemed to be no help for him; time
passed, and he could contrive no means of escape.</p>
<p>One day he noticed that a sunbeam entered the stable through a hole.
He changed himself into a mouse and ran out. His master saw him,
however, and pursued him as a cat. The mouse ran, the cat followed.
Just when the cat was about to seize him in his mouth, the mouse turned
into a fish swimming in a stream. The master turned into a net and
followed him; the fish swam away, but the net came after him. Just when
the net was going to cover him, the fish changed into a pheasant and
flew away. The master pursued him as a falcon. The pheasant flew on and
the falcon followed. When the falcon was about to put its claws into
him, he turned into a red apple, and rolled into the king's lap. The
falcon changed into a knife in the king's hand. Just when the king was
going to cut the apple, it changed into a <i>codi</i> (80 lbs.) of
millet spread on a cloth. The devil changed himself into a brood-hen,
and began to eat it. When it had eaten almost all, and only left one
grain, this grain turned into a needle, and rolled in front of the hen,
which changed into a thread in the eye of the needle. As it was about
to hold back the needle, the needle ran into the fire and burned the
thread. The boy thus escaped from the devil, went home to his father,
and lived happily ever afterwards. <a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>
