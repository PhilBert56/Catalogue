<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Once upon
a time there was a woman, and she baked five pies. And when they came out of
the oven, they were that overbaked the crusts were too hard to eat. So she says
to her daughter:<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Darter,"
says she, "put you them there pies on the shelf, and leave 'em there a
little, and they'll come again."--She meant, you know, the crust would get
soft.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">But the
girl, she says to herself: "Well, if they'll come again, I'll eat 'em
now." And she set to work and ate 'em all, first and last.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well,
come supper-time the woman said: "Go you, and get one o' them there pies.
I dare say they've come again now."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">The girl
went and she looked, and there was nothing but the dishes. So back she came and
says she: "Noo, they ain't come again."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Not
one of 'em?" says the mother.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Not
one of 'em," says she.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Well,
come again, or not come again," said the woman "I'll have one for
supper."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"But
you can't, if they ain't come," said the girl.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"But
I can," says she. "Go you, and bring the best of 'em."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Best
or worst," says the girl, "I've ate 'em all, and you can't have one
till that's come again."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well, the
woman she was done, and she took her spinning to the door to spin, and as she
span she sang:<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"My
darter ha' ate five, five pies to-day. My darter ha' ate five, five pies
to-day."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">The king
was coming down the street, and he heard her sing, but what she sang he
couldn't hear, so he stopped and said:<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"What
was that you were singing, my good woman?"<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">The woman
was ashamed to let him hear what her daughter had been doing, so she sang,
instead of that:<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"My
darter ha' spun five, five skeins to-day. My darter ha' spun five, five skeins
to-day."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Stars
o' mine!" said the king, "I never heard tell of any one that could do
that."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Then he
said: "Look you here, I want a wife, and I'll marry your daughter. But
look you here," says he, "eleven months out of the year she shall
have all she likes to eat, and all the gowns she likes to get, and all the
company she likes to keep; but the last month of the year she'll have to spin
five skeins every day, and if she don't I shall kill her."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"All
right," says the woman; for she thought what a grand marriage that was.
And as for the five skeins, when the time came, there'd be plenty of ways of
getting out of it, and likeliest, he'd have forgotten all about it.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well, so
they were married. And for eleven months the girl had all she liked to eat, and
all the gowns she liked to get, and all the company she liked to keep.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">But when
the time was getting over, she began to think about the skeins and to wonder if
he had 'em in mind. But not one word did he say about 'em, and she thought he'd
wholly forgotten 'em.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">However,
the last day of the last month he takes her to a room she'd never set eyes on
before. There was nothing in it but a spinning-wheel and a stool. And says he:
"Now, my dear, here you'll be shut in to- morrow with some victuals and
some flax, and if you haven't spun five skeins by the night, your head'll go
off."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">And away
he went about his business.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well, she
was that frightened, she'd always been such a gatless girl, that she didn't so much
as know how to spin, and what was she to do to-morrow with no one to come nigh
her to help her? She sat down on a stool in the kitchen, and law! how she did
cry!<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">However,
all of a sudden she heard a sort of a knocking low down on the door. She upped
and oped it, and what should she see but a small little black thing with a long
tail. That looked up at her right curious, and that said:<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"What
are you a-crying for?"<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"What's
that to you?" says she.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Never
you mind," that said, "but tell me what you're a-crying for."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"That
won't do me no good if I do," says she.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"You
don't know that," that said, and twirled that's tail round.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Well,"
says she, "that won't do no harm, if that don't do no good," and she
upped and told about the pies, and the skeins, and everything.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"This
is what I'll do," says the little black thing, "I'll come to your
window every morning and take the flax and bring it spun at night."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"What's
your pay?" says she.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">That
looked out of the corner of that's eyes, and that said: "I'll give you
three guesses every night to guess my name, and if you haven't guessed it
before the month's up you shall be mine."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well, she
thought she'd be sure to guess that's name before the month was up. "All
right," says she, "I agree."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"All
right," that says, and law! how that twirled that's tail.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well, the
next day, her husband took her into the room, and there was the flax and the
day's food.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Now
there's the flax," says he, "and if that ain't spun up this night,
off goes your head." And then he went out and locked the door.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">He'd
hardly gone, when there was a knocking against the window.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">She upped
and she oped it, and there sure enough was the little old thing sitting on the
ledge.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Where's
the flax?" says he.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Here
it be," says she. And she gave it to him.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well,
come the evening a knocking came again to the window. She upped and she oped
it, and there was the little old thing with five skeins of flax on his arm.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Here
it be," says he, and he gave it to her.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Now,
what's my name?" says he.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"What,
is that Bill?" says she.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Noo,
that ain't," says he, and he twirled his tail.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Is
that Ned?" says she.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Noo,
that ain't," says he, and he twirled his tail.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Well,
is that Mark?" says she.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Noo,
that ain't," says he, and he twirled his tail harder, and away he flew.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well,
when her husband came in, there were the five skeins ready for him. "I see
I shan't have to kill you to-night, my dear," says he; "you'll have
your food and your flax in the morning," says he, and away he goes.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well,
every day the flax and the food were brought, and every day that there little
black impet used to come mornings and evenings. And all the day the girl sat
trying to think of names to say to it when it came at night. But she never hit
on the right one. And as it got towards the end of the month, the impet began
to look so maliceful, and that twirled that's tail faster and faster each time
she gave a guess.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">At last
it came to the last day but one. The impet came at night along with the five
skeins, and that said,<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"What,
ain't you got my name yet?"<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Is
that Nicodemus?" says she.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Noo,
t'ain't," that says.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Is
that Sammle?" says she.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Noo,
t'ain't," that says.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"A-well,
is that Methusalem?" says she.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Noo,
t'ain't that neither," that says.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Then that
looks at her with that's eyes like a coal o' fire, and that says: "Woman,
there's only to-morrow night, and then you'll be mine!" And away it flew.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well, she
felt that horrid. However, she heard the king coming along the passage. In he
came, and when he sees the five skeins, he says, says he,<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Well,
my dear," says he, "I don't see but what you'll have your skeins
ready to-morrow night as well, and as I reckon I shan't have to kill you, I'll
have supper in here to-night." So they brought supper, and another stool for
him, and down the two sat.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well, he
hadn't eaten but a mouthful or so, when he stops and begins to laugh.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"What
is it?" says she.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"A-why,"
says he, "I was out a-hunting to-day, and I got away to a place in the
wood I'd never seen before And there was an old chalk- pit. And I heard a kind
of a sort of a humming. So I got off my hobby, and I went right quiet to the
pit, and I looked down. Well, what should there be but the funniest little
black thing you ever set eyes on. And what was that doing, but that had a
little spinning-wheel, and that was spinning wonderful fast, and twirling
that's tail. And as that span that sang:<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Nimmy
nimmy not My name's Tom Tit Tot."<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Well,
when the girl heard this, she felt as if she could have jumped out of her skin
for joy, but she didn't say a word.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">Next day
that there little thing looked so maliceful when he came for the flax. And when
night came, she heard that knocking against the window panes. She oped the
window, and that come right in on the ledge. That was grinning from ear to ear,
and Oo! that's tail was twirling round so fast.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"What's
my name?" that says, as that gave her the skeins.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Is
that Solomon?" she says, pretending to be afeard.<o:p></o:p></span>


<br>
<span style="font-size: 15pt;" lang="EN-GB">"Noo,
t'ain't," that says, and that came further into the room.<o:p></o:p></span>
