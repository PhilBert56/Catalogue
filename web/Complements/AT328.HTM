<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p></o:p></span></p>







































<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Once
upon a time there was a man and a wife had too many children, and<o:p></o:p> they
could not get meat for them, so they took the three youngest and<o:p></o:p> left
them in a wood. They travelled and travelled and could see never<o:p></o:p> a house.
It began to be dark, and they were hungry. At last they saw a<o:p></o:p> light
and made for it; it turned out to be a house. They knocked at<o:p></o:p> the
door, and a woman came to it, who said: "What do you want?" They<o:p></o:p> said:
"Please let us in and give us something to eat." The woman said:<o:p></o:p><br>
"I
can't do that, as my man is a giant, and he would kill you if he<o:p></o:p> comes
home." They begged hard. "Let us stop for a little while," said<o:p></o:p> they,
"and we will go away before he comes." So she took them in, and<o:p></o:p> set them
down before the fire, and gave them milk and bread; but just<o:p></o:p> as they
had begun to eat a great knock came to the door, and a<o:p></o:p> dreadful
voice said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



























<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Fee, fie, fo, fum,<o:p></o:p><span style=""> </span>I smell the blood of some earthly one.<o:p></o:p> Who have
you there wife?" "Eh," said the wife, "it's three poor<o:p></o:p> lassies
cold and hungry, and they will go away. Ye won't touch 'em,<o:p></o:p> man."
He said nothing, but ate up a big supper, and ordered them to<o:p></o:p> stay all
night. Now he had three lassies of his own, and they were to<o:p></o:p> sleep in
the same bed with the three strangers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>






























<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The
youngest of the three strange lassies was called Molly Whuppie,<o:p></o:p> and she
was very clever. She noticed that before they went to bed the<o:p></o:p> giant
put straw ropes round her neck and her sisters', and round his<o:p></o:p> own
lassies' necks he put gold chains. So Molly took care and did not<o:p></o:p> fall
asleep, but waited till she was sure every one was sleeping<o:p></o:p> sound.
Then she slipped out of the bed, and took the straw ropes off<o:p></o:p> her own
and her sisters' necks, and took the gold chains off the<o:p></o:p> giant's
lassies. She then put the straw ropes on the giant's lassies<o:p></o:p> and the
gold on herself and her sisters, and lay down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>










































<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">And in
the middle of the night up rose the giant, armed with a great<o:p></o:p> club,
and felt for the necks with the straw. It was dark. He took his<o:p></o:p> own
lassies out of bed on to the floor, and battered them until they<o:p></o:p> were
dead, and then lay down again, thinking he had managed fine.<o:p></o:p><br>
Molly
thought it time she and her sisters were out of that, so she<o:p></o:p> wakened
them and told them to be quiet, and they slipped out of the<o:p></o:p> house.
They all got out safe, and they ran and ran, and never stopped<o:p></o:p> until
morning, when they saw a grand house before them. It turned out<o:p></o:p> to be a
king's house: so Molly went in, and told her story to the<o:p></o:p> king. He
said: "Well, Molly, you are a clever girl, and you have<o:p></o:p> managed
well; but, if you would manage better, and go back, and steal<o:p></o:p> the
giant's sword that hangs on the back of his bed, I would give your<o:p></o:p> eldest
sister my eldest son to marry." Molly said she would try.<o:p></o:p></span></p>




































<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">So she
went back, and managed to slip into the giant's house, and<o:p></o:p> crept in
below the bed. The giant came home, and ate up a great<o:p></o:p> supper,
and went to bed. Molly waited until he was snoring, and she<o:p></o:p> crept
out, and reached over the giant and got down the sword; but just<o:p></o:p> as she
got it out over the bed it gave a rattle, and up jumped the<o:p></o:p> giant,
and Molly ran out at the door and the sword with her; and she<o:p></o:p> ran, and
he ran, till they came to the "Bridge of one hair"; and she<o:p></o:p> got
over, but he couldn't, and he says, "Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie!<o:p></o:p> never ye
come again." And she says "Twice yet, carle," quoth she,<o:p></o:p> "I'll
come to Spain." So Molly took the sword to the king, and her<o:p></o:p> sister
was married to his son.<o:p></o:p></span></p>










































<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Well,
the king he says: "Ye've managed well, Molly; but if ye would<o:p></o:p> manage
better, and steal the purse that lies below the giant's pillow,<o:p></o:p> I would
marry your second sister to my second son." And Molly said she<o:p></o:p> would
try. So she set out for the giant's house, and slipped in, and<o:p></o:p> hid
again below the bed, and waited till the giant had eaten his<o:p></o:p> supper,
and was snoring sound asleep. She slipped out, and slipped her<o:p></o:p> hand
below the pillow, and got out the purse; but just as she was<o:p></o:p> going
out the giant wakened, and ran after her; and she ran, and he<o:p></o:p> ran,
till they came to the "Bridge of one hair," and she got over, but<o:p></o:p> he
couldn't, and he said, "Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie! never you come<o:p></o:p> again."
"Once yet, carle," quoth she, "I'll come to Spain." So
Molly<o:p></o:p> took the
purse to the king, and her second sister was married to the<o:p></o:p> king's
second son.<o:p></o:p></span></p>







































<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">After
that the king says to Molly: "Molly, you are a clever girl, but<o:p></o:p> if you
would do better yet, and steal the giant's ring that he wears<o:p></o:p> on his
finger, I will give you my youngest son for yourself." Molly<o:p></o:p> said she
would try. So back she goes to the giant's house, and hides<o:p></o:p> herself
below the bed. The giant wasn't long ere he came home, and,<o:p></o:p> after he
had eaten a great big supper, he went to his bed, and shortly<o:p></o:p> was
snoring loud. Molly crept out and reached over the bed, and got<o:p></o:p> hold of
the giant's hand, and she pulled and she pulled until she got<o:p></o:p> off the
ring; but just as she got it off the giant got up, and gripped<o:p></o:p> her by
the hand, and he says: "Now I have catcht you, Molly Whuppie,<o:p></o:p> and, if
I had done as much ill to you as ye have done to me, what<o:p></o:p> would ye
do to me?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


















<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Molly
says: "I would put you into a sack, and I'd put the cat inside<o:p></o:p> with
you, and the dog aside you, and a needle and thread and a shears,<o:p></o:p> and I'd
hang you up upon the wall, and I'd go to the wood, and choose<o:p></o:p> the
thickest stick I could get, and I would come home, and take you<o:p></o:p> down,
and bang you till you were dead."<o:p></o:p></span></p>






<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>"Well,
Molly," says the giant, "I'll just do that to you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>












<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>So he
gets a sack, and puts Molly into it, and the cat and the dog<o:p></o:p> beside
her, and a needle and thread and shears, and hangs her up upon<o:p></o:p> the
wall, and goes to the wood to choose a stick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>






<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Molly
she sings out: "Oh, if ye saw what I see."<o:p></o:p></span></p>






<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>"Oh,"
says the giant's wife, "what do ye see, Molly?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>






<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>But
Molly never said a word but, "Oh, if ye saw what I see!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


















<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>The
giant's wife begged that Molly would take her up into the sack<o:p></o:p> till she
would see what Molly saw. So Molly took the shears and cut a<o:p></o:p> hole in
the sack, and took out the needle and thread with her, and<o:p></o:p> jumped
down and helped, the giant's wife up into the sack, and sewed<o:p></o:p> up the
hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


















<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>The
giant's wife saw nothing, and began to ask to get down again; but<o:p></o:p> Molly
never minded, but hid herself at the back of the door. Home came<o:p></o:p> the
giant, and a great big tree in his hand, and he took down the<o:p></o:p> sack,
and began to batter it. His wife cried, "It's me, man;" but the<o:p></o:p> dog
barked and the cat mewed, and he did not know his wife's voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>















<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">But
Molly came out from the back of the door, and the giant saw her,<o:p></o:p> and he
after her; and he ran and she ran, till they came to the<o:p></o:p> "Bridge
of one hair," and she got over but he couldn't; and he said,<o:p></o:p> "Woe
worth you, Molly Whuppie! never you come again." "Never more,<o:p></o:p> carle,"
quoth she, "will I come again to Spain."<o:p></o:p></span></p>












<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">So Molly
took the ring to the king, and she was married to his<o:p></o:p> youngest

<p class="MsoPlainText">JACK AND THE BEANSTALK<br>
<br>
JACK SELLS THE COW<br>
<br>
ONCE upon a time there was a poor widow who lived in a little cottage with her only son Jack.<br>
<br>
Jack was a giddy, thoughtless boy, but very kind-hearted and
affectionate. There had been a hard winter, and after it the poor woman
had suffered from fever and ague. Jack did no work as yet, and by
degrees they grew dreadfully poor. The widow saw that there was no
means of keeping Jack and herself from starvation but by selling her
cow; so one morning she said to her son, `I am too weak to go myself,
Jack, so you must take the cow to market for me, and sell her.'<br>
<br>
Jack liked going to market to sell the cow very much; but as he was on
the way, he met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand.
Jack stopped to look at them, and the butcher told the boy that they
were of great value, and persuaded the silly lad to sell the cow for
these beans.<br>
<br>
When he brought them home to his mother instead of the money she
expected for her nice cow, she was very vexed and shed many tears,
scolding Jack for his folly. He was very sorry, and mother and son went
to bed very sadly that night; their last hope seemed gone.<br>
<br>
At daybreak Jack rose and went out into the garden.<br>
<br>
`At least,' he thought, `I will sow the wonderful beans. Mother says
that they are just common scarlet-runners, and nothing else; but I may
as well sow them.'<br>
<br>
So he took a piece of stick, and made some holes in the ground, and put in the beans.<br>
<br>
That day they had very little dinner, and went sadly to bed, knowing
that for the next day there would be none and Jack, unable to sleep
from grief and vexation, got up at day-dawn and went out into the
garden.<br>
<br>
What was his amazement to find that the beans had grown up in the
night, and climbed up and up till they covered the high cliff that
sheltered the cottage, and disappeared above it! The stalks had twined
and twisted themselves together till they formed quite a ladder.<br>
<br>
`It would be easy to climb it,' thought Jack.<br>
<br>
And, having thought of the experiment, he at once resolved to carry it
out, for Jack was a good climber. However, after his late mistake about
the cow, he thought he had better consult his mother first.<br>
<br>
<br>
WONDERFUL GROWTH OF THE BEANSTALK<br>
<br>
<br>
So Jack called his mother, and they both gazed in silent wonder at the
Beanstalk, which was not only of great height, but was thick enough to
bear Jack's weight.<br>
<br>
`I wonder where it ends,' said Jack to his mother; `I think I will climb up and see.'<br>
<br>
His mother wished him not to venture up this strange ladder, but Jack
coaxed her to give her consent to the attempt, for he was certain there
must be something wonderful in the Beanstalk; so at last she yielded to
his wishes.<br>
<br>
Jack instantly began to climb, and went up and up on the ladder-like
bean till everything he had left behind him--the cottage, the village,
and even the tall church tower--looked quite little, and still he could
not see the top of the Beanstalk.<br>
<br>
Jack felt a little tired, and thought for a moment that he would go
back again; but he was a very persevering boy, and he knew that the way
to succeed in anything is not to give up. So after resting for a moment
he went on.<br>
<br>
After climbing higher and higher, till he grew afraid to look down for
fear he should be giddy, Jack at last reached the top of the Beanstalk,
and found himself in a beautiful country, finely wooded, with beautiful
meadows covered with sheep. A crystal stream ran through the pastures;
not far from the place where he had got off the Beanstalk stood a fine,
strong castle.<br>
<br>
Jack wondered very much that he had never heard of or seen this castle before; but when he reflected on the subject, he saw that<br>
it was as much separated from the village by the perpendicular rock on which it stood as if it were in another land.<br>
<br>
While Jack was standing looking at the castle, a very strange-looking woman came out of the wood, and advanced towards him.<br>
<br>
She wore a pointed cap of quilted red satin turned up with ermine, her
hair streamed loose over her shoulders, and she walked with a staff.
Jack took off his cap and made her a bow.<br>
<br>
`If you please, ma'am,' said he, `is this your house?'<br>
<br>
`No,' said the old lady. `Listen, and I will tell you the story of<br>
that castle.<br>
<br>
`Once upon a time there was a noble knight, who lived in this castle,
which is on the borders of Fairyland. He had a fair and beloved wife
and several lovely children: and as his neighbours, the little people,
were very friendly towards him, they bestowed on him many excellent and
precious gifts.<br>
<br>
`Rumour whispered of these treasures; and a monstrous giant, who lived
at no great distance, and who was a very wicked being, resolved to
obtain possession of them.<br>
<br>
`So he bribed a false servant to let him inside the castle, when the
knight was in bed and asleep, and he killed him as he lay. Then he went
to the part of the castle which was the nursery, and also killed all
the poor little ones he found there.<br>
<br>
`Happily for her, the lady was not to be found. She had gone with her
infant son, who was only two or three months old, to visit her old
nurse, who lived in the valley; and she had been detained all night
there by a storm.<br>
<br>
`The next morning, as soon as it was light, one of the servants at the
castle, who had managed to escape, came to tell the poor lady of the
sad fate of her husband and her pretty babes. She could scarcely
believe him at first, and was eager at once to go back and share the
fate of her dear ones; but the old nurse, with many tears, besought her
to remember that she had still a child, and that it was her duty to
preserve her life for the sake of the poor innocent.<br>
<br>
`The lady yielded to this reasoning, and consented to remain at her
nurse's house as the best place of concealment; for the servant told
her that the giant had vowed, if he could find her, he would kill both
her and her baby. Years rolled on. The old nurse died, leaving her
cottage and the few articles of furniture it contained to her poor
lady, who dwelt in it, working as a peasant for her daily bread. Her
spinning-wheel and the milk of a cow, which she had purchased with the
little money she had with her, sufficed for the scanty subsistence of
herself and her little son. There was a nice little garden attached to
the cottage, in which they cultivated peas, beans, and cabbages, and
the lady was not ashamed to go out at<br>
harvest time, and glean in the fields to supply her little son's wants.<br>
<br>
`Jack, that poor lady is your mother. This castle was once your father's, and must again be yours.'<br>
<br>
Jack uttered a cry of surprise.<br>
<br>
`My mother! oh, madam, what ought I to do? My poor father! My dear mother!'<br>
<br>
`Your duty requires you to win it back for your mother. But the task is a very difficult one, and full of peril, Jack. Have you<br>
courage to undertake it?'<br>
<br>
`I fear nothing when I am doing right,' said Jack.<br>
<br>
`Then,' said the lady in the red cap, `you are one of those who slay
giants. You must get into the castle, and if possible possess<br>
yourself of a hen that lays golden eggs, and a harp that talks.<br>
Remember, all the giant possesses is really yours.' As she ceased
speaking, the lady of the red hat suddenly disappeared, and of course<br>
Jack knew she was a fairy.<br>
<br>
Jack determined at once to attempt the adventure; so he advanced, and blew the horn which hung at the castle portal. The<br>
door was opened in a minute or two by a frightful giantess, with one great eye in the middle of her forehead.<br>
<br>
As soon as Jack saw her he turned to run away, but she caught him, and dragged him into the castle.<br>
<br>
`Ho, ho!' she laughed terribly. `You didn't expect to see me here, that is clear! No, I shan't let you go again. I am weary of<br>
my life. I am so overworked, and I don't see why I should not have a page as well as other ladies. And you shall be my boy. You<br>
shall clean the knives, and black the boots, and make the fires, and
help me generally when the giant is out. When he is at home I<br>
must hide you, for he has eaten up all my pages hitherto, and you would be a dainty morsel, my little lad.'<br>
<br>
While she spoke she dragged Jack right into the castle. The poor boy
was very much frightened, as I am sure you and I would have been in his
place. But he remembered that fear disgraces a man; so he struggled to
be brave and make the best of things.<br>
<br>
`I am quite ready to help you, and do all I can to serve you, madam,'
he said, `only I beg you will be good enough to hide me from your
husband, for I should not like to be eaten at all.'<br>
<br>
`That's a good boy,' said the Giantess, nodding her head; `it is lucky
for you that you did not scream out when you saw me, as the other boys
who have been here did, for if you had done so my husband would have
awakened and have eaten you, as he did them, for breakfast. Come here,
child; go into my wardrobe: he never ventures to open THAT; you will be
safe there.'<br>
<br>
And she opened a huge wardrobe which stood in the great hall, and shut
him into it. But the keyhole was so large that it admitted plenty of
air, and he could see everything that took place through it. By-and-by
he heard a heavy tramp on the stairs, like the lumbering along of a
great cannon, and then a voice like thunder cried out;<br>
<br>
`Fe, fa, fi-fo-fum,<br>
I smell the breath of an Englishman.<br>
Let him be alive or let him be dead,<br>
I'll grind his bones to make my bread.'<br>
<br>
<br>
`Wife,' cried the Giant, `there is a man in the castle. Let me have him for breakfast.'<br>
<br>
`You are grown old and stupid,' cried the lady in her loud tones. `It
is only a nice fresh steak off an elephant, that I have cooked for you,
which you smell. There, sit down and make a good breakfast.'<br>
<br>
And she placed a huge dish before him of savoury steaming meat, which
greatly pleased him, and made him forget his idea of an Englishman
being in the castle. When he had breakfasted he went out for a walk;
and then the Giantess opened the door, and made Jack come out to help
her. He helped her all day. She fed him well, and when evening came put
him back in the wardrobe.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE HEN THAT LAYS GOLDEN EGGS.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Giant came in to supper. Jack watched him through the keyhole, and
was amazed to see him pick a wolf's bone, and put half a fowl at a time
into his capacious mouth.<br>
<br>
When the supper was ended he bade his wife bring him his hen that laid the golden eggs.<br>
<br>
`It lays as well as it did when it belonged to that paltry knight,' he said; `indeed I think the eggs are heavier than ever.'<br>
<br>
The Giantess went away, and soon returned with a little brown hen,
which she placed on the table before her husband. `And now, my dear,'
she said, `I am going for a walk, if you don't want me any longer.'<br>
<br>
`Go,' said the Giant; `I shall be glad to have a nap by-and-by.'<br>
<br>
Then he took up the brown hen and said to her:<br>
<br>
`Lay!' And she instantly laid a golden egg.<br>
<br>
`Lay!' said the Giant again. And she laid another.<br>
<br>
`Lay!' he repeated the third time. And again a golden egg lay<br>
on the table.<br>
<br>
Now Jack was sure this hen was that of which the fairy had spoken.<br>
<br>
By-and-by the Giant put the hen down on the floor, and soon after went
fast asleep, snoring so loud that it sounded like thunder. Directly
Jack perceived that the Giant was fast asleep, he pushed open the door
of the wardrobe and crept out; very softly he stole across the room,
and, picking up the hen, made haste to quit the apartment. He knew the
way to the kitchen, the door of which he found was left ajar; he opened
it, shut and locked it after him, and flew back to the Beanstalk, which
he descended as fast as his feet would move.<br>
<br>
When his mother saw him enter the house she wept for joy, for she had
feared that the fairies had carried him away, or that the Giant had
found him. But Jack put the brown hen down before her, and told her how
he had been in the Giant's castle, and all his adventures. She was very
glad to see the hen, which would make them rich once more.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE MONEY BAGS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jack made another journey up the Beanstalk to the Giant's castle one
day while his mother had gone to market; but first he dyed his hair and
disguised himself. The old woman did not know him again, and dragged
him in as she had done before, to help her to do the work; but she
heard her husband coming, and hid him in the wardrobe, not thinking
that it was the same boy who had stolen the hen. She bade him stay
quite still there, or the Giant would eat him.<br>
<br>
Then the Giant came in saying:<br>
<br>
`Fe, fa, fi-fo-fum,<br>
I smell the breath of an Englishman.<br>
Let him be alive or let him be dead,<br>
I'll grind his bones to make my bread.'<br>
<br>
<br>
`Nonsense!' said the wife, `it is only a roasted bullock that I thought would be a tit-bit for your supper; sit down and I will<br>
bring it up at once.' The Giant sat down, and soon his wife brought up a roasted bullock on a large dish, and they began their<br>
supper. Jack was amazed to see them pick the bones of the bullock as if it had been a lark. As soon as they had finished their<br>
meal, the Giantess rose and said:<br>
<br>
`Now, my dear, with your leave I am going up to my room to finish the story I am reading. If you want me call for me.'<br>
<br>
`First,' answered the Giant, `bring me my money bags, that I may count my golden pieces before I sleep.' The Giantess obeyed.<br>
She went and soon returned with two large bags over her shoulders, which she put down by her husband.<br>
<br>
`There,' she said; `that is all that is left of the knight's money.<br>
When you have spent it you must go and take another baron's castle.'<br>
<br>
`That he shan't, if I can help it,' thought Jack.<br>
<br>
The Giant, when his wife was gone, took out heaps and heaps of golden
pieces, and counted them, and put them in piles, till he was<br>
tired of the amusement. Then he swept them all back into their bags,
and leaning back in his chair fell fast asleep, snoring so loud that no
other sound was audible.<br>
<br>
Jack stole softly out of the wardrobe, and taking up the bags of money
(which were his very own, because the Giant had stolen them from his
father), he ran off, and with great difficulty descending the
Beanstalk, laid the bags of gold on his mother's table. She had just
returned from town, and was crying at not finding Jack.<br>
<br>
`There, mother, I have brought you the gold that my father lost.'<br>
<br>
`Oh, Jack! you are a very good boy, but I wish you would not risk your
precious life in the Giant's castle. Tell me how you came to go there
again.'<br>
<br>
And Jack told her all about it.<br>
<br>
Jack's mother was very glad to get the money, but she did not like him to run any risk for her.<br>
<br>
But after a time Jack made up his mind to go again to the Giant's castle.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE TALKING HARP.<br>
<br>
<br>
So he climbed the Beanstalk once more, and blew the horn at the Giant's
gate. The Giantess soon opened the door; she was very stupid, and did
not know him again, but she stopped a minute before she took him in.
She feared another robbery; but Jack's fresh face looked so innocent
that she could not resist him, and so she bade him come in, and again
hid him away in the wardrobe.<br>
<br>
By-and-by the Giant came home, and as soon as he had crossed the threshold he roared out:<br>
<br>
`Fe, fa, fi-fo-fum,<br>
I smell the breath of an Englishman.<br>
Let him be alive or let him be dead,<br>
I'll grind his bones to make my bread.'<br>
<br>
<br>
`You stupid old Giant,' said his wife, `you only smell a nice sheep, which I have grilled for your dinner.'<br>
<br>
And the Giant sat down, and his wife brought up a whole sheep for his dinner. When he had eaten it all up, he said:<br>
<br>
`Now bring me my harp, and I will have a little music while you take your walk.'<br>
<br>
The Giantess obeyed, and returned with a beautiful harp. The framework
was all sparkling with diamonds and rubies, and the strings were all of
gold.<br>
<br>
`This is one of the nicest things I took from the knight,' said the
Giant. `I am very fond of music, and my harp is a faithful servant.'<br>
<br>
So he drew the harp towards him, and said:<br>
<br>
`Play!'<br>
<br>
And the harp played a very soft, sad air.<br>
<br>
`Play something merrier!' said the Giant.<br>
<br>
And the harp played a merry tune.<br>
<br>
`Now play me a lullaby,' roared the Giant; and the harp played a sweet lullaby, to the sound of which its master fell asleep.<br>
<br>
Then Jack stole softly out of the wardrobe, and went into the huge
kitchen to see if the Giantess had gone out; he found no one there, so
he went to the door and opened it softly, for he thought he could not
do so with the harp in his hand.<br>
<br>
Then he entered the Giant's room and seized the harp and ran away with it; but as he jumped over the threshold the harp called<br>
out:<br>
<br>
`MASTER! MASTER!'<br>
<br>
And the Giant woke up.<br>
<br>
With a tremendous roar he sprang from his seat, and in two strides had reached the door.<br>
<br>
But Jack was very nimble. He fled like lightning with the harp, talking
to it as he went (for he saw it was a fairy), and telling it he<br>
was the son of its old master, the knight.<br>
<br>
Still the Giant came on so fast that he was quite close to poor Jack,
and had stretched out his great hand to catch him. But, luckily, just
at that moment he stepped upon a loose stone, stumbled, and fell flat
on the ground, where he lay at his full length.<br>
<br>
This accident gave Jack time to get on the Beanstalk and hasten down
it; but just as he reached their own garden he beheld the Giant
descending after him.<br>
<br>
`Mother I mother!' cried Jack, `make haste and give me the axe.'<br>
<br>
His mother ran to him with a hatchet in her hand, and Jack with one tremendous blow cut through all the Beanstalks except one.<br>
<br>
`Now, mother, stand out of the way!' said he.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE GIANT BREAKS HIS NECK.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jack's mother shrank back, and it was well she did so, for just as the
Giant took hold of the last branch of the Beanstalk, Jack cut the stem
quite through and darted from the spot.<br>
<br>
Down came the Giant with a terrible crash, and as he fell on his head,
he broke his neck, and lay dead at the feet of the woman he had so much
injured.<br>
<br>
Before Jack and his mother had recovered from their alarm and agitation, a beautiful lady stood before them.<br>
<br>
`Jack,' said she, `you have acted like a brave knight's son, and
deserve to have your inheritance restored to you. Dig a grave and bury
the Giant, and then go and kill the Giantess.'<br>
<br>
`But,' said Jack, `I could not kill anyone unless I were fighting with
him; and I could not draw my sword upon a woman. Moreover, the Giantess
was very kind to me.'<br>
<br>
The Fairy smiled on Jack.<br>
<br>
`I am very much pleased with your generous feeling,' she said.<br>
`Nevertheless, return to the castle, and act as you will find needful.'<br>
<br>
Jack asked the Fairy if she would show him the way to the castle, as
the Beanstalk was now down. She told him that she would drive him there
in her chariot, which was drawn by two peacocks. Jack thanked her, and
sat down in the chariot with her.<br>
<br>
The Fairy drove him a long distance round, till they reached a village
which lay at the bottom of the hill. Here they found a number of
miserable-looking men assembled. The Fairy stopped her carriage and
addressed them:<br>
<br>
`My friends,' said she, `the cruel giant who oppressed you and ate up
all your flocks and herds is dead, and this young gentleman was the
means of your being delivered from him, and is the son of your kind old
master, the knight.'<br>
<br>
The men gave a loud cheer at these words, and pressed forward to say
that they would serve Jack as faithfully as they had served his father.
The Fairy bade them follow her to the castle, and they marched thither
in a body, and Jack blew the horn and demanded admittance.<br>
<br>
The old Giantess saw them coming from the turret loop-hole. She was
very much frightened, for she guessed that something had happened to
her husband; and as she came downstairs very fast she caught her foot
in her dress, and fell from the top to the bottom and broke her neck.<br>
<br>
When the people outside found that the door was not opened to them,
they took crowbars and forced the portal. Nobody was to be seen, but on
leaving the hall they found the body of the Giantess at the foot of the
stairs.<br>
<br>
Thus Jack took possession of the castle. The Fairy went and brought his
mother to him, with the hen and the harp. He had the Giantess buried,
and endeavoured as much as lay in his power to do right to those whom
the Giant had robbed.<br>
<br>
Before her departure for fairyland, the Fairy explained to Jack that
she had sent the butcher to meet him with the beans, in order to try
what sort of lad he was.<br>
<br>
If you had looked at the gigantic Beanstalk and only stupidly wondered
about it,' she said, `I should have left you where misfortune had
placed you, only restoring her cow to your mother.<br>
But you showed an inquiring mind, and great courage and enterprise,
therefore you deserve to rise; and when you mounted the Beanstalk<br>
you climbed the Ladder of Fortune.'<br>
<br>
She then took her leave of Jack and his mother.<br>
