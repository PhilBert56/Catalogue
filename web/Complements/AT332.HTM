<p>THERE was a man, very poor in this world's goods, whose wife
presented him with a baby boy. No one was willing to stand sponsor,
because he was so very poor. The father said to himself: 'Dear Lord, I
am so poor that no one is willing to be at my service in this matter;
I'll take the baby, I'll go, and I'll ask the first person I meet to
act as sponsor, and if I don't meet anybody, perhaps the sexton will
help me.' He went and met Death, but didn't know what manner of person
she was; she was a handsome woman, like any other woman. He asked her
to be godmother. She didn't make any excuse, and immediately saluted
him as parent of her godchild, took the baby in her arms, and carried
him to church. The little lad was properly christened. When they came
out of church, the child's father took the godmother to an inn, and
wanted to give her a little treat as godmother. But she said to him,
'Gossip, <a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">*</font></a> leave this alone,
and come with me to my abode.' She took him with her to her apartment,
which was very handsomely furnished. Afterwards she conducted him into
great vaults, and through these vaults they went right into the
underworld in the dark. There tapers were burning of three
sizes--small, large, and middle-sized; and those which were not yet
alight were very large. The godmother said to the godchild's father:
'Look, Gossip, here I have the duration of everybody's life.' The
child's father gazed thereat, found there a tiny taper close to the
very ground, and asked her: 'But, Gossip, I pray you, whose is this
little taper close to the ground?' She said to him: 'That is yours!
When any taper whatsoever burns down, I must go for that man.' He said
to her: 'Gossip, I pray you, give me somewhat additional.' She said to
him: 'Gossip, I cannot do that!' Afterwards she went and lighted a
large new taper for the baby boy whom they had had christened.
Meanwhile, while the godmother was not looking, the child's father took
for himself a large new taper, lit it, and placed it where his tiny
taper was burning down.</p>
<p>The godmother looked round at him and said: 'Gossip, you ought not
to have done that to me; but if you have given yourself additional
lifetime, you have done so and possess it. Let us go hence, and we'll
go to your wife.'</p>
<p>She took a present, and went with the child's father and the child
to the mother. She arrived, and placed the boy on his mother's bed, and
asked her how she was, and whether she had any pain anywhere. The
mother confided her griefs to her, and the father sent for some beer,
and wanted to entertain her in his cottage, as godmother, in order to
gratify her and show his gratitude. They drank and feasted together.
Afterwards the godmother said to her godchild's father: 'Gossip, you
are so poor that no one but myself would be at your service in this
matter; but never mind, you shall bear me in memory! I will go to the
houses of various respectable people and make them ill, and you shall
physic and cure them. I will tell you all the remedies. I possess them
all, and everybody will be glad to recompense you well, only observe
this: When I stand at anyone's feet, you can be of assistance to every
such person; but if I stand at anybody's head, don't attempt to aid
him.' It came to pass. The child's father went from patient to patient,
where the god-mother caused illness, and benefited every one. All at
once he became a distinguished physician. A prince was dying--nay, he
had breathed his last--nevertheless, they sent for the physician. He
came, he began to anoint him with salves and give him his powders, and
did him good. When he had restored him to health, they paid him well,
without asking how much they were indebted. Again, a count was dying.
They sent for the physician again. The physician came. Death was
standing behind the bed at his head. The physician cried: 'It's a bad
case, but we'll have a try.' He summoned the servants, and ordered them
to turn the bed round with the patient's feet towards Death, and began
to anoint him with salves and administer powders into his mouth, and
did him good. The count paid him in return as much as he could carry
away, without ever asking how much he was indebted; he was only too
glad that he had restored him to health. When Death met the physician,
she said to him: 'Gossip, if this occurs to you again, don't play me
that trick any more. True, you have done him good, but only for a
while; I must, none the less, take him off whither he is due.' The
child's father went on in this way for some years; he was now very old.
But at last he was wearied out, and asked Death herself to take him.
Death was unable to take him, because he had given himself a long
additional taper; she was obliged to wait till it burned out. One day
he drove to a certain patient to restore him to health, and did so.
Afterwards Death revealed herself to him, and rode with him in his
carriage. She began to tickle and play with him, and tap him with a
green twig under the throat; he threw himself into her lap, and went
off into the last sleep. Death laid him in the carriage, and took
herself off. They found the physician lying dead in his carriage, and
conveyed him home. The whole town and all the villages lamented: 'That
physician is much to be regretted. What a good doctor he was! He was of
great assistance; there will never be his like again!' His son remained
after him, but had not the same skill.</p>
<p>The son went one day into church, and his godmother met him. She
asked him: 'My dear son, how are you?' He said to her: 'Not all alike;
so long as I have what my dad saved up for me, it is well with me, but
after that the Lord God knows how it will be with me.' His godmother
said: 'Well, my son, fear nought. I am your christening mamma; I helped
your father to what he had, and will give you, too, a livelihood. You
shall go to a physician as a pupil, and you shall be more skilful than
he, only behave nicely.' After this she anointed him with salve over
the ears, and conducted him to a physician. The physician didn't know
what manner of lady it was, and what sort of son she brought him for
instruction. The lady enjoined her son to behave nicely, and requested
the physician to instruct him well, and bring him into a good position.
Then she took leave of him and departed. The physician and the lad went
together to gather herbs, and each herb cried out to the pupil what
remedial virtue it had, and the pupil gathered it. The physician also
gathered herbs, but knew not, with regard to any herb, what remedial
virtue it possessed. The pupil's herbs were beneficial in every
disease. The physician said to the pupil: 'You are cleverer than I, for
I diagnose no one that comes to me; but you know herbs counter to every
disease. Do you know what? Let us join partnership. I will give my
doctor's diploma up to you, and will be your assistant, and am willing
to be with you till death.' The lad was successful in doctoring and
curing till his taper burned out in limbo.</p>
