Fairy Tales [1913], at sacred-texts.com</font></p>
The three Orange Peris<br>
<p>IN olden time, when there was abundance of all things, we ate and
drank the whole day long, yet went hungry to bed. At this time there
lived a Padishah whose days were joyless, for he had no son. </p>
<p>Sorrowfully he set out with his lala, and as they wandered, drinking
coffee and smoking tobacco, they came to a wide valley. They sat down
to rest, and suddenly the valley resounded with the cracking of whips,
and a white. bearded dervish, clad in green, with yellow shoes,
appeared before them. The Padishah and his companion trembled with
fright, but when the dervish approached and saluted them with "Selâmin
alejküm!" they took courage and re. turned the greeting: "Ve alejküm
selâm!"</p>
<p>"Whither bound, Padishah?" inquired the dervish.</p>
<p>"If thou knowest that I am the Padishah thou canst also tell me the
remedy for my grief," answered he.</p>
<p>Taking an apple from his breast and presenting it to the Padishah,
the dervish said: "Give one half to the Sultana and eat the other
yourself," and immediately disappeared.</p>
<p>The Padishah accordingly went home, gave half of the apple to his
consort and ate the other half himself, and before long a Shahzada, or
Crown Prince, was born in the palace. The Padishah was beside himself
with joy. He gave money to the poor, set slaves free, and prepared a
feast for everybody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;THE Prince grew and attained his fourteenth year. One day he
accosted his father with the request: "My Padishah and father, have
built for me a small marble palace, with two fountains, from one of
which shall flow oil and from the other honey."</p>
<p>The Padishah loved his only son so much that he ordered the palace
to be built with the two fountains, in accordance with the boy's
desire. Now as the Prince sat in his palace looking on the two
fountains which yielded oil and honey, an old woman appeared with a jug
in her hand, intending to fill it at the fountain. The Prince took up a
stone and cast it at the old woman's jug and broke it to pieces.
Without a word the woman withdrew. Next day she came again, and just as
she was about to fill her jug the Prince once more threw a stone and
broke the vessel. Without a word the old woman went away. On the third
day she reappeared, and for the third time her jug was shattered by the
Prince. Said the old woman: "I pray Allah thou mayst be smitten with
love for the three Orange Peris." She then went away, and was seen no
more.</p>
<p>From that moment the Prince was seized as with a devouring fire. He
pined and faded, and the Padishah, observing his son's condition,
called in physicians and hodjas, but no one could cure the Prince's
malady. "Oh, Shah," said the son to his father one day, "my dear
father, these people can do me no good; their efforts are in vain. I
love the three Orange Fairies, and shall have no peace till I find
them."</p>
<p>"Oh, my child," lamented the Padishah, "thou art my only one. If
thou forsake me, then can I have no joy."</p>
<p>But as the Prince continued to get worse, the Padishah thought it
better to withhold no longer his permission for the boy's setting out;
he might perhaps find the three fairies and return home.
</p>
<p>Laden with costly treasures the Prince set forth. Over hill and down
dale, ever onward he pursued his way. On a boundless plain he found
himself suddenly confronted with the gigantic Dew-mother. Standing
astride upon two hills, one foot on each, she crunched resin in her
jaws, and the sound could be heard two miles away. Her breathing raised
storms, and her arms were nine yards long.</p>
<p>"How do you do, mother?" the youth said to her, putting his arm
round her waist.</p>
<p>"Hadst thou not called me 'mother' I would have swallowed thee,"
returned the woman. Then she asked him whence he came and whither he
would go.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear mother," sighed the boy, "such misfortune is mine that it
were better you did not ask and I did not answer."</p>
<p>"But tell me," demanded the woman.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear mother," he sighed again, "I am in love with the three
Orange Fairies. Can you not show me the way to them?"</p>
<p>"Silence!" commanded the woman; "it is forbidden to utter that word.
I and my sons guard ourselves against them but I know not where they
dwell. I have forty sons, who go up and down in the earth; perhaps they
may know."</p>
<p>When evening came, before the return of the Dew-sons, the woman
picked up the Prince and struck him gently, whereupon he was trans
formed into a water-jug.</p>
<p>She was only just in time, for suddenly the forty Dew-fellows
appeared and cried: "We smell the flesh of man, mother!"</p>
<p>"But," returned the mother, "what should a man be doing here? You
had better sit down to your supper."</p>
<p>So the Dew-fellows sat down to their meal, during the course of
which the mother inquired: "If you had a mortal brother, what would you
do with him?"</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>"What should we do with him?" they all answered in chorus. "We
should love him as a brother."</p>
<p>&nbsp;ON receiving this assurance the Dew-mother struck the
water-jug and the Prince appeared. "Here is your brother," she said,
presenting him to her forty sons. The Dews welcomed the youth with joy,
called him their brother, gave him a place beside them, and demanded of
their mother why she had not produced him before the meal. "My
children," she replied, "he could not have eaten the food you are
accustomed to; mortals eat fowl, beef, mutton and such."</p>
<p>Immediately one of the Dews got up, fetched a sheep, and set it
before the youth.</p>
<p>"You simpleton!" scolded the woman; "it must first be cooked."</p>
<p>So the imp took the sheep away, and returned with it roasted,
setting it once more before the Prince. Having eaten till he was
satisfied, the Prince put the rest aside. Noticing this, the imps
inquired why he did not eat it all, and their mother informed them that
the children of men did not eat so much as Dew-fellows.</p>
<p>"Let us see how mutton tastes," said one of the imps, and in a
couple of mouthfuls the whole sheep was gone.</p>
<p>Next morning the woman said to her sons: "your brother has great
grief." "What is it?" they asked; "we may be able to help him." "He is
in love with the three Orange Fairies," proceeded the mother. "We know
not the dwelling-place of the Orange Fairies; we never go in their
neighbourhood; but perhaps our aunt knows." "Take the youth to her,"
ordered the woman; "greet her on my behalf, tell her this is my son,
and that I wish her, if possible, to help him." The Dews accordingly
conducted the Prince to their aunt, and told her all.</p>
<p>This old witch had sixty sons, and not knowing herself where the
Orange Fairies lived, she awaited the return of her progeny. As she was
uncertain how her sons would receive the visitor, she struck him gently
and turned him into a vessel. "We smell the flesh of man!" the Dews
shouted as they ran into the room. "No doubt you have been eating human
flesh," answered their mother. "Now come to your supper." The sons sat
down to eat eagerly. Then the woman struck the vessel, and the sixty
Dews, on beholding the little mortal, received him heartily, offered
him a seat, and set food before him.
</p>
<p>"My sons," said the imps' mother on the following day, "this child
is in love with the three Orange Fairies; can you not take him to
them?" "It is certain we cannot," they answered, "but perhaps our other
aunt knows the way." "Then take him to her," said the woman; "greet her
on my behalf, tell her the boy is my son and will be hers; she may be
able to help him."</p>
<p>The imps accordingly conducted the youth to their aunt and related
all. "Oh, my children," she answered, "I can do nothing, but when my
eighty sons return this evening I will inquire of them."</p>
<p>The sixty Dews took leave of the Prince, and toward evening the Dew.
mother gave him a knock and turned him into a broom, which she put
behind the door. Hardly had she done this than the eighty Dews came
home, and began muttering about the smell of human flesh. During supper
their mother asked them what they would do if they had a mortal
brother. As they all swore a solemn oath to do him no harm, she took
the broom, struck it lightly, and the Prince appeared.</p>
<p>The imps received him cordially, inquired after his health, and set
food before him. Then the woman asked them whether they knew where the
three Orange Fairies lived, as their new brother was in love with them.
With a cry of joy the youngest Dew-son sprang up and said that he knew.
"Then," rejoined the mother, "take the youth there that he may
accomplish his desire."</p>
<p>Next morning the imp and the Prince set out on their journey. As
they proceeded the young Dew said: "Brother, we shall soon reach a
large garden, in which there is a pond, where the three oranges will be
found.</p>
<p><span class="contnote"><font color="green" size="-2"></font></span>When
I cry, 'Shut your eyes--open your eyes!' do so, and seize whatever
presents itself."</p>
<p>&nbsp;ROCEEDING a little farther, they came to the garden, and as
the Dew caught sight of the pond he cried to the Prince: "Shut your
eyes--open your eyes!" The Prince saw the three oranges on the smooth
surface of the pond, seized one and put it in his pocket. Again the Dew
cried: "Shut your eyes--open your eyes!" Obeying, the Prince seized the
second orange, and likewise the third. "Now," said the Dew, "take care
not to open the oranges at any spot where there is no water, or you
will repent it." Promising to follow his advice, the Prince parted from
the Dew, the one going to the right, the other to the left.</p>
<p>As the Prince travelled up hill and down dale he remembered the
oranges and took one out of his pocket with the intention of opening
it. Hardly had he inserted his knife in the peel than a lovely maiden,
beautiful as the full moon, sprang out, crying: "Water! give me water!"
and as there was no water near, she vanished immediately. The Prince
deeply regretted what he had done, but it could not be helped now.</p>
<p>Some hours elapsed, he had walked many miles, and again he thought
of the oranges. He took out the second, slit it, and behold! out sprang
a maiden lovelier than the first. She also demanded water, and, seeing
none, likewise vanished.</p>
<p>"I must take better care of the third," thought the Prince as he
tramped wearily onward. On reaching a spring he drank of it, and
resolved to open his third orange. He did so, and a maiden more lovely
than either of the others appeared. As she also asked for water, the
Prince led her to the spring, gave her to drink, and she remained with
him.</p>
<p>The Prince was anxious that the maiden should enter his father's
city with befitting state. So he persuaded her to hide in a tree near
the spring, while he went to fetch a coach and gorgeous raiment. When
he had gone away a black slave-woman came to the spring for water.
Seeing therein the reflection of the maiden from the tree above, and
thinking it was her own image, she soliloquised: "I am much more
beautiful than my mistress. Why should I carry water for her? Rather
should she carry it for me," and she threw down her jug so violently
that it broke in pieces. She returned to the house, and when her
mistress asked where the jug was, the negress turned upon her
scornfully " I am more beautiful than you; henceforth you must fetch me
water." The mistress, holding up the mirror, answered "Are you out of
your wits? Look in the glass," and the negress, looking, saw that she
was really black. Without another word she again took a jug and went to
the spring to fill it. Arrived there, she saw a second time the
reflection of the maiden in the tree and mistook it for her own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"I am after all more beautiful than my mistress," she cried
aloud. Throwing down her jug, she once more went to the house. Again
the mistress asked why she had brought no water. "I am more beautiful
than you; you must fetch me water," was the retort. "you are mad,
girl," returned the mistress, again holding the mirror up before the
swarthy face of the slave, who, realising that she was indeed a
negress, took a third jug and went yet a third time to the spring. The
reflection of the maiden again appeared in the water, and the negress
was just about to dash her jug to pieces when the maid called to her
from the tree: "Break not your jug; what you behold in the water is my
reflection, not your own."</p>
<p>The negress looked up, and seeing in the tree a being so wondrously
beautiful lovelier than anyone she had ever seen before--she addressed
her in words of honeyed flattery:</p>
<p>"Oh, most charming of all maidens, surely you must be tired from
sitting up there so long. Come down and lay your weary head in my lap."</p>
<p>The bait was taken, and as the maiden's head lay in her lap, the
negress took a hair pin and thrust it into her skull. But at the very
moment the murderous intention was accomplished the maiden was trans
formed into an orange coloured bird and flew away, leaving the negress
by the tree.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards the Prince returned in a magnificent coach, and
clad in gold brocade. Glancing at the tree and seeing the swarthy
features of the negress, he asked what had happened. "Leave me here and
go away," answered the negress. "The sun has quite spoilt my
complexion." What could the poor Prince do? He put the supposed maiden
in the coach and took her to his father's palace.</p>
<p>The courtiers awaited the arrival of the fairy bride with eager
curiosity; when they saw the negress they were at a loss to imagine
what the Prince could find attractive about her. "She is not a
negress," explained the Prince; "only as she was in the sun so long she
has become somewhat sunburnt; she will soon become white again." With
these words he led her to her apartments.</p>
<p>Near the Prince's palace was a large garden. Here one day the Orange
Bird flew in, and, alighting on a tree, called to the gardener.</p>
<p>"What wilt thou of me?" asked the gardener.</p>
<p>"How is the Prince?" inquired the bird.</p>
<p>"Quite well," was the answer.</p>
<p>"And how is his black wife?" was the next inquiry.</p>
<p>"Oh, she is quite well, but keeps to her apartments," replied the
gardener.</p>
<p>At this the bird flew off. Next day it came again, and repeated the
questions of the previous day. On the third day also it did the same;
and it came to pass that every tree on which the bird had sat withered
away. Shortly afterward, as the Prince was walking in the garden,
seeing so many withered trees he spoke to the gardener. "Why do you not
take proper care of these trees?" he asked; "they are all withered! "
Hereupon the gardener related the incident of the bird and its
questions, and observed that though he had done his utmost for the
trees it was all in vain. The Prince commanded him to smear the trees
with birdlime, and when the bird was caught to bring it himself to the
palace. So the bird was caught and taken to the Prince, who put it in a
cage.</p>
<p>As soon as the negress saw the bird she knew it was really the
beautiful maiden. She now pretended to be dangerously ill, sent for the
chief physicians, and, bribing them, got them to report to the Prince
that only by eating a certain kind of bird could she possibly recover.</p>
<p>When the Prince heard that his wife was very ill he called the
physicians before him and asked what was to be done. They told him that
the Princess could only be cured if a certain kind of bird were given
her to eat. "1 have lately caught such a bird," said the Prince, and he
commanded that the captive should be killed and served up to his wife.
But by chance one of the bird's beautiful feathers fell to the floor,
and lodged, without anyone observing it, between two planks.</p>
<p>Time passed, and the Prince was still waiting for his wife to turn
white. In the palace was an old woman who taught reading and writing to
the inmates. One day, being about to ascend the stairs, she espied a
bright object. She picked it up, and saw that it was a bird's feather
with spots on it that sparkled like diamonds. She took the feather to
her own room and stuck it in a crevice in the wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;ONE day while she was in attendance at the palace the feather
fell from its position, and ere it could reach the floor, behold! it
was trans formed into a lovely maiden, of dazzling beauty. The maiden
swept the floor, cooked the dinner, and put everything in order, after
which she resumed the form of a feather and went back to her place on
the wall. When the old governess arrived home she was astonished. She
looked everywhere, but could find no clue to the riddle.</p>
<p>Next morning while she was in the palace the feather again assumed
human form and acted as on the day before. On the third day the old
woman, determined to solve the mystery, instead of leaving her
apartments locked the door as though she intended to go to the palace
as usual, but hid herself. Soon she saw a maiden in the room, who,
after putting everything in proper order, set about the cooking. When
all was ready the dame ran in and caught the mysterious maiden and
demanded an explanation. The latter related her adventures, telling how
the negress had twice taken her life, and how she had come there in the
form of a feather.</p>
<p>"Grieve not, my daughter," said the old dame, consoling her, "I will
soon put the matter right.' She lost no time in going to the Prince,
whom she invited to supper the same evening.</p>
<p>After supper coffee was brought in, and as the maiden set down the
cups the Prince chanced to look into her face, and immediately swooned
away.</p>
<p>When he had been brought to consciousness again he asked who the
maiden was. "My servant," answered the old woman. "Whence have you
obtained her?" demanded the Prince. "Will you not sell her to me?" "How
can I sell you what already belongs to you?" returned the dame. Taking
the maiden by the hand, she led her to the Prince, exhorting him
thenceforth to guard his Orange Fairy with more care.</p>
<p>The Prince took his true bride home in triumph to his palace,
ordered the negress to instant execution, and celebrated his new
wedding feast for forty days and forty nights. This happy end attained,
we will once more stretch ourselves on our divan.</p>
